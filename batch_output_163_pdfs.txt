Brandon Sanderson’s novel series, the Stormlight 
Archive, is epic in every sense of the word. The 
sweeping scope of Brandon’s narrative is enough to 
fill five substantial novels, with another five to come. 
The gripping story and unparalleled world-building 
have inspired a legion of fans to read and reread not 
only these stories, but the entire Cosmere universe  
of fantasy fiction.
What you hold in your hands is not a weighty tome. 
It’s a sampler and teaser, designed specifically for 
people who haven’t read the Stormlight novels. 
This booklet introduces Roshar, a world of conflict, 
storms, and Investiture. Divine forces shaped this 
planet, some leading to subjugation and cruelty, 
others cultivating ideals of growth and honor. It’s a 
world where flawed heroes gain incredible powers by 
forging bonds and seeking redemption.
If you’re playing the Cosmere RPG  and beginning 
an adventure in the Stormlight campaign setting, 
this guide illustrates Roshar’s unique world-building 
and tells you what a typical citizen of Eastern Roshar 
would know about the world without revealing any 
character or plot spoilers for The Way of Kings .
Welcome to a universe unlike any other, and a 
fantasy setting as captivating as it is alien. Welcome 
to Roshar! We hope this is just the first step of 
your journey.

Highstorms
No force has shaped Roshar’s ecology and culture more 
completely than highstorms : hurricane-force storms of 
incredible power that sweep across the continent about once per 
five-day week, always traveling from east to west. Heralded by  
a powerful stormwall with enough strength to hurl boulders, 
highstorms can be incredibly destructive. However, the highstorm  
also infuses Roshar with incredible energy called Stormlight .
Spheres
Throughout Roshar, spheres  are the 
most commonly accepted currency. 
Small gemstones embedded in glass, 
their denominations are based on the 
size and type of gems inside. Well-cut 
gemstones glow for several days when 
infused with Stormlight, so merchants 
distrust dun spheres. Infused spheres 
glow brightly enough to be a helpful 
light source, especially when multiple 
spheres are placed in a lantern, and 
most people carry at least one sphere 
for good luck.A bridgeman looks east toward

A World of Storms and WarRoshar has three moons : 
blue Nomon, green Mishim, 
and violet Salas.
Shardbearers
Across Roshar, two relics are prized above all other 
material possessions: Shardblades  and Shardplate . 
Shardblades slice effortlessly through any unliving 
matter, and kill foes with a single strike, leaving no 
wounds except burning eyes. Fueled by Stormlight, 
Shardplate is the only armor that can deflect 
a Shardblade, and each suit endows its bearer 
with superhuman speed and strength. A single 
Shardbearer can turn the tide of an entire battle,  
and wars have been fought to claim a single Blade  
or suit of Plate.A Vast Supercontinent
Roshar is the name of the planet and its single 
continent. The majority of the continent’s terrain is 
stone, and its storm-swept lands are harsh. However, 
this world is far from barren. Every type of biome can 
be found on Roshar, from snow-capped mountains to 
lush jungles.

Vegetation
Plants on Roshar have evolved to survive the regular 
onslaught of highstorms, resembling aquatic life on 
other worlds. When a highstorm approaches, plants 
retract their vines and leaves, only to unfurl them 
when the storm passes. They react the same  
way to animals, shrinking away from  
passing travelers or foraging beasts.
Varied Adaptations
Rosharan plants employ a 
range of adaptations to protect 
themselves from highstorms. 
Many plants wrap and withdraw 
their leaves and tendrils. Jella 
trees and prickletacs absorb 
crem and form stone-like trunks. 
Thaylen deadfall trees lie flat 
during storms. In eastern Roshar, 
many plants grow only on the 
leeward side of cliffsides, taking 
shelter in protected laits. 
6Ecology
Jella tree
Valaplume
Eyes of IshiStone and Crem
On most of Roshar, soil would be quickly 
washed away by the strength of highstorms. 
Instead, plants cling directly to the stony 
terrain with strong roots. Soil and mud are 
alien to most Rosharans, but when a highstorm 
passes, it leaves behind a coating of mineral-
rich crem  that acts as fertilizer for Rosharan 
flora. Crem is clay-like when wet, and can be 
shaped into pottery, but hardens quickly and 
must be chipped away before it covers every 
surface exposed to the elements.
Rockbuds
Rockbuds are a family of hard-shelled plants found across 
Roshar, especially in the east. Like other Rosharan flora, 
rockbuds can contract during highstorms and bloom 
afterward. The seeds of lavis polyps, a variety of rockbud, 
can be dried and served as grain. Lavis grain is a staple 
food for people around the world, served with curry, 
steamed in leaf wraps, or ground into flour.In the sheltered mountain nation of Shinovar , highstorms pass 
as gentle rainfall. Plants grow in soil and do not retreat when trod 
upon. Shinovar is home to strange animals seen nowhere else, 
including chickens in all shapes, sizes, and colors. It is the only 
nation in the world where wild horses thrive, and Shin horses are 
prized throughout Roshar.

Rosharan fauna has adapted to the harsh environment 
of a storm-torn world. Most animals on Roshar possess 
hardened exoskeletons or leathery hide to protect their 
bodies from severe weather and other beasts. Aside 
from domesticated hogs and minks, mammals are rare. 
Mollusks, amphibians, and crustaceans are better suited 
to survive the relentless onslaught of highstorms.
Whitespine
A horse-sized pack hunter 
with razor-sharp tusks 
and fearsome claws, the 
whitespine  is one of Roshar’s 
deadliest predators.Cremlings
Diminutive crustaceans called 
cremlings  are Roshar’s ever-
present scavengers, found in 
countless varieties, colors,  
and ecological niches.
Chasmfiend
No creature on Roshar is more feared than the chasmfiend , a massive 
greatshell that roams the Shattered Plains. Forty feet high and eighty feet 
long, the chasmfiend is an apex predator with nearly impenetrable carapace. 
Only an army, or a highly skilled Shardbearer, can reliably bring one down.Marine Greatshells
The largest animals in the world hide 
beneath the waves. From the drifting  
santhid  to the fearsome yu-nerig , these 
aquatic greatshells can grow to titanic sizes.

Aerial predators called skyeels  
are a familiar sight in the  
skies of port cities, gliding

Axehound
The axehound  is a carnivorous 
crustacean common in the wild, 
but domesticated axehounds have 
been bred for hunting, fighting, 
security, and companionship. Horses and Ryshadium
Horses  are rare and precious animals, and even a Shin 
Thoroughbred can easily cost a thousand spheres. 
Ryshadium , however, are priceless. Majestic beasts 
who stand several hands taller than ordinary horses, 
they have stone hooves and the strength to carry a 
Shardbearer in full Plate.Chull
The chull , which retreats into its 
shell during highstorms, is slow but 
powerful. Chulls can grow to nearly 
twice the size shown here, and 
make reliable beasts of burden.

animals moving at high speeds. Folktales 
describe them as mischievous spirits who 
enjoy causing people to trip or stumble.
Rotspren
LifesprenThe manifestations called spren  
are one of Roshar’s most unique 
features. Called spirits by the 
Shin and gods by the Unkalaki, 
spren are a ubiquitous part of 
everyday life for people around 
the world. They typically appear 
as luminous shapes in the air or 
upon the ground, and manifest in 
response to specific phenomena.
Nature Spren
Many spren appear as reactions to natural 
phenomena. Rotspren have ghostly mite-like forms 
that crawl over decaying bodies or infected wounds. 
Lifespren are glowing green motes that hover above 
healthy plants, and sometimes in densely populated 
human settlements.

On Roshar, when people feel strong emotions, they can attract 
a seemingly endless variety of emotion spren. Red angerspren  
pool like blood at the feet of enraged soldiers, yellow shockspren  
might shatter in the air around a scandalized noble, and leaf-
shaped joyspren  swirl around reuniting friends. While they are 
vivid, spren have no physical substance. Ordinary people consider 
emotion spren an unremarkable fact of life. Only scholars and 
philosophers question their existence and purpose.

11One Land, Many Nations
Thousands of years ago, during the age of Desolations, 
Roshar was united into ten Silver Kingdoms. T oday, 
the continent is divided into many warring kingdoms 
and city-states. Some trace their legacy back to the 
Heraldic Epochs, while others are relatively new. All 
have grown and changed over time, resulting in a rich 
tapestry of cultures, ethnicities, and religions.
Millennia ago, the island nation of 
Aimia fell during an event known 
as the scouring. T oday it is a barren, 
abandoned wasteland.
Roshar’s supercontinent occupies the planet’s 
southern hemisphere, so it is hottest in the northern 
lands, while its southern waters are nearly ice-cold.
A continental shelf extends 
beneath the shallow Reshi Sea.
Highstorms arrive from the 
east. Many tales exist of sailors 
seeking the Origin of Storms, 
but no ship has ever returned 
safely from such a journey.
Mountains on the continent’s 
eastern edge provide some 
protection from the westward 
procession of highstorms.
Alethi
The militaristic kingdom of Alethkar  
glorifies conquest, hierarchy, and 
competition.
Natan
The remnant of a once-mighty 
civilization, New Natanan  is a bleak 
hinterland shaped by highstorms.Azish
The sprawling Azish Empire  is known 
for bureaucracy, logistics, and intricate 
codes of law.
Reshi
Every island in the Reshi Isles  has its 
own independent culture, ranging 
from warlike to relaxed.Herdazian
Herdaz  is a coastal nation of prolific 
agriculturalists who value family and 
community.
Shin
The isolationist nation of Shinovar  
is a mystery to the people of 
eastern Roshar.

believe their ancestors were travelers 
from other worlds.

wealthy. Vorins worship a monotheistic god they call the Almighty , 
a creator god said to reside in the hearts of all people. Vorinism 
preaches the value of oaths, honor, law, and obedience to rigid social 
hierarchy. Vorinism imposes a caste system that divides darkeyed 
common folk from lighteyed nobles. It also enforces traditional

The Lost Radiants
Vorinism teaches that the Almighty chose ten Heralds to fight 
against the Voidbringers  during the time of Desolations. These 
Voidbringers were servants of evil who sought to drive humans 
into Damnation, just as they had once cast humanity out of 
the Tranquiline Halls. A group of knights, now called the Lost 
Radiants , fought beside the Heralds. While they were once regarded 
as heroes, they failed catastrophically. On a day called the Recreance, 
they betrayed their oaths. The Vorin church rarely speaks of the 
fallen knights, and only then as archetypal pretenders and traitors.

and historians agree on their importance, and they 
are key figures in most religions. In the Azish Empire, 
they are individually worshipped as gods. In the Vorin 
Kingdoms, people regard the Heralds as immortal 
servants of the Almighty who eternally fight the 
Voidbringers in the Tranquiline Halls. Though stories 
vary, each Herald is associated with certain qualities 
and a particular domain. The wisdom of the Heralds 
still guides religious leaders and scholars today, 
though their lives have passed into legend.
17Heralds of the AlmightyThe Azish Empire  stretches 
across southwestern Roshar. 
Its ten member states have 
unique cultures and govern-
ments, but all pay homage 
to the Prime Aqasix, who 
rules from the Bronze Palace 
in Azimir. Azish people 
are renowned as experts in 
bureaucracy, logistics, and 
complex legal codes. 
Religion
Nations in western Roshar do not practice 
Vorinism. Each Azish nation worships 
one Herald as its god. Purelakers openly 
praise a jealous god called Vun Makak 
while secretly revering his virtuous 
brother, Nu Ralik. In Shinovar, people 
are said to believe that stone is sacred.Shinovar  is a mountain enclave 
where soil covers the ground and 
plants do not retreat when trod 
upon. Its people raise horses, 
revere stone, and abhor violence.In the vast but shallow Purelake , 
peaceful people live in villages 
built upon the water. Purelakers 
believe their fish have curative 
properties and bring good fortune.

Western Roshar stretches from 
the tropical Reshi Isles to the 
frigid badlands of Tukar, but 
every nation in the west has 
milder weather than the east, 
because their lands are more 
sheltered from highstorms.
The archipelago of the Reshi Isles  is home 
to a host of tribes and monarchies, some of 
which sit upon the backs of colossal great-
shells called the T ai-na . Entire jungles, hill-
sides, and villages can thrive upon a T ai-na.In the Iriali city of Rall Elorim , residents live in hanging stalactites 
and buildings carved from the mountainside. After highstorms, 
waterfalls pour into cisterns that collect in the city’s huge reservoir.

The nations of eastern Roshar comprise the Vorin kingdoms : 
Alethkar, Jah Keved, Kharbranth, New Natanatan, and 
Thaylenah. The northern coastal nation of Herdaz also 
practices Vorinism, though Herdazians take a more relaxed 
view of certain strictures.
In spite of their common religion, these nations are frequently 
at war. Alethkar is the most common aggressor, but Jah 
Keved is nearly as warlike. Only the Unkalaki and Natans, 
geographically isolated from their neighbors, manage to avoid 
border disputes.

Eastern RosharTechnology
In recent generations, Rosharans 
have made remarkable advance-
ments in fabrial  technology. 
Fabrials are devices consisting of 
spren contained in gemstones 
and powered by Stormlight. 
Artifabrians  are the scientists 
who invent new fabrials. 
Many are concentrated in the 
maritime nation of Thaylenah , 
a hub for merchants and 
traveling scholars.
In eastern Roshar, men pursue the art 
of war while women find their callings 
in scholarship. Men can have books 
read to them, or join the ardentia if they 
wish to become scholars. Otherwise, 
books are written in women’s script and 
contain undertext commentary that is 
only read by female scholars.Ruled by the elderly King T aravangian, 
the sheltered city-state of Kharbranth  
is home to the world’s greatest library, 
the Palanaeum. It is also renowned for 
its world-class hospitals and surgeons.The hardy Unkalaki  people live in the frozen Horneater Peaks, home to vast crater 
lakes that they call oceans. These emerald pools provide life-giving warmth to

Rank-and-file soldiers wield spears, 
as only lighteyes are allowed to 
carry swords. Squadleader is the 
highest rank a darkeyed officer 
can hope to achieve, but every 
spearman dreams of defeating an 
enemy Shardbearer and leaping up 
the ranks of Alethi social hierarchy.The nation of Alethkar is the largest on 
Roshar, and its military is unparalleled. 
More than one hundred thousand 
soldiers are supported by Shardbearers, 
Soulcasters, and a robust civilian corps. 
Within the past generation, the nation 
has risen to prominence under the rule 
of King Gavilar Kholin. He and his 
brother Dalinar conquered the warring 
highprinces to form a unified nation. 
Competition and War
A spirit of brutal competition and 
rigid social hierarchy underpins 
Alethi society. Even after unification, 
the highprinces still pit their soldiers 
against one another in deadly border 
disputes, and lighteyes regularly face 
each other in duels. Alethi warriors 
frequently experience the Thrill,  
a berserker rage that removes a 
warrior’s inhibitions.Lighteyed nobles, wearing the

Social hierarchy is directly linked to 
bloodline, marked by eye shade. Only 
lighteyed  people own land and hold 
political power. Whether their eyes 
are tan or green, violet or blue, the 
colors are strikingly pale.Darkeyes
Darkeyed  people, the majority of 
Alethi, range from peasants to skilled 
professionals. Their eyes come in a 
range of colors in dark shades. They 
often endure cruel treatment at the 
hands of privileged lighteyes.Slaves
Slavery  is legal in Alethkar, and 
is especially prevalent in times of 
war. Prisoners of war, debtors, and 
accused criminals are pressed into 
back-breaking servitude or placed on 
the front lines of bloody battles.
Strategic Resources
While most nations are lucky to field a handful of Shard-
bearers, Alethkar commands more than thirty. Soulcasters  
are just as vital. Using Stormlight, these holy artifacts can 
transform stone to grain, or clay into steel, allowing Alethi 
armies to fight without reliance on long supply lines.

The listeners  are a people who make their homes 
in the Shattered Plains. Among humans they are 
known by their Alethi name, Parshendi , meaning 
“parshmen who can think.” They appear to be closely 
related to parshmen, with skin in stark shades of red, 
black, and white resembling marbled stone. But where 
parshmen rarely speak, and demonstrate little in the 
way of free will, the Parshendi are an independent

Alethi soldiers have been shocked to realize that listener armies 
include both malen and femalen warriors, distinguished only 
by facial hair. Most combatants bear distinctive red carapace 
armor, which does not seem to impede their movement, or 
their ability to leap across chasms. Listener scouts and civilians 
are almost indistinguishable from parshmen, but typically have 
hairstrands that resemble thick strands of grass.
T o the highprinces’ surprise, the Parshendi have their own 
Shardbearers. They avoid risking their Shards in pitched 
battles, always supporting them with elite warriors.Listener children exploring together. The modern age, the Era of Solitude , 
has been defined by humankind 
forging its own path. For millennia, no 
Desolations have devastated the world. 
Neither Heralds nor Voidbringers have 
appeared to guide people toward virtue 
or vice. However, the winds are shifting. 
Dying people whisper words of prophecy: 
a new age is on the horizon. 
The Assassin in White
On the night of a banquet honoring 
Parshendi envoys visiting the Alethi 
capital city, King Gavilar Kholin was 
assassinated by a man wearing white 
robes and wielding a Shardblade. This 
man, Szeth son-son-Vallano, possessed 
uncanny abilities like those described in 
folktales of the Lost Radiants. Gavilar is 
not the last monarch he will kill.
The War of Reckoning
After the death of the Alethi king, the Parshendi 
emissaries declared responsibility. Shocked and 
enraged, the Alethi highprinces swore the Vengeance 
Pact, marching their armies to the Shattered Plains 
with the goal of wiping out the Parshendi.
What began with an act of vengeful unity has 
descended into infighting between the highprinces. 
The Alethi discovered that the chasmfiends native 
to the Shattered Plains contain massive emerald 
gemhearts, each worth tens of thousands of spheres. 
The gemhearts could be harvested from pupating 
chasmfiends, prompting a race between the Alethi 
highprinces whenever one is sighted. The Parshendi 
also vie for the gemhearts, leading to relentless battles 
that never escalate into a full-blown war of conquest. 
The warcamps have become the new center of  
Alethi power, where soldiers die in droves while  
the highprinces jockey for power.

“Do you hear that? It is the 
roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.
 Despite your self-sufficiency, you 
tire of a life alone. Your clan is far, but 
these companions are the closest thing 
to a tribe. As long as they can prove 
themselves worthy of your company, you 
will travel with them.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, a fiercely 
proud member of a noble clan. The clan 
outweighs everything else in your life, 
even the stated law of the land.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.

the Emerald Enclave, defenders of 
the wild lands.
 Personality Trait. You once ran 
25 miles to warn your clan of an 
approaching threat, and you’d do 
the same again.
 Ideal. To dishonor yourself is to 
dishonor the clan.
 Bond.  Your clan is the most important 
thing in your life, even when they are 
far from you.

clan of an approaching orc horde. I’d do it 
again if I had to.
 Ideal. Life is like the seasons, 
in constant change, and we must 
change with it.
 Bond.  I am the last of my tribe, and 
it is up to me to ensure their names 
enter legend.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.

Land’s Stride. Moving through 
nonmagical difficult terrain costs you 
no extra movement. You can also pass 
through nonmagical plants without 
being slowed by them and without taking 
damage from them if they have thorns, 
spines, or a similar hazard.
 In addition, you have advantage on 
saving throws against plants that are 
magically created or manipulated to 
impede movement, such as those created 
by the entangle spell.
Hide in Plain Sight. You can spend 1 
minute creating camouflage for yourself. 
You must have access to fresh mud, 
dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally 
occurring materials with which to create 
your camouflage.
 Once you are camouflaged in this way, 
you can try to hide by pressing yourself 
up against a solid surface, such as a tree 
or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as 
you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity

there without moving or taking actions. 
Once you move or take an action or a 
reaction, you must camouflage yourself 
again to gain this benefit.

Colossus Slayer. When you hit a creature 
with a weapon attack, the creature takes

“I apologize for cutting off your fascinating diatribe with my blade in your belly. Small talk was 
never my strong suit.”
You have spent decades studying the 
art of combat, refining your skills with relentless vigor. Cunning and patient, your mind plays out each attack and 
counter before you strike for maximum 
effect. Though your magical repertoire is extremely limited, the spells you have chosen enhance your already prodigious ability.
Background (Sage)
You are a serious student of all forms of combat. Despite your studious nature, 
you are aware that there are limits to 
practice and simulation. It is time to conduct some real-world application of your deadly art. Adventuring companions 
are usually the type who will need 
a steady hand and quick wits to bail them out, often. Thankfully, you have both to spare.
 Researcher. If you do not know a piece 
of information, you usually know where 
and from whom that knowledge can be obtained. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. You use polysyllabic 
words that convey the impression of great erudition. Ideal. The path to power and self-
improvement is through knowledge. Bond. Your life’s work is the Tome 
of Battle , a treatise related to your 
theories on combat.
 Flaw.  You speak without really 
thinking through your words, invariably 
insulting others.
High Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep. You may only learn spells of the 
abjuration and evocation schools.

 You weren’t a desperate orphan, 
scratching out a living on the mean

you are a master of adaptation to your 
environment—be it urban, dungeon, 
or the wild.
Background (Criminal)
You are an experienced criminal with 
a history of breaking the law. You have

Dragon Ancestor.  Whenever you make 
a Charisma check when interacting with 
dragons, your proficiency is doubled if it 
applies to the check.
Draconic Resilience. As magic flows 
through your body, it causes physical 
traits of your dragon ancestor to emerge. 
Your hit point maximum increases by 
1 at 1st level and whenever you gain a 
sorcerer level.
 Additionally, parts of your body are 
covered by a thin sheen of dragon-
like scales. When you aren’t wearing 
armor, your AC equals 13 + your 
Dexterity modifier.
Spellcasting. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for your sorcerer 
spells. You use your Charisma whenever 
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
 To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish

“Do you hear that? It is the 
roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.
 Despite your self-sufficiency, you 
tire of a life alone. Your clan is far, but 
these companions are the closest thing 
to a tribe. As long as they can prove 
themselves worthy of your company, you 
will travel with them.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, a fiercely 
proud member of a noble clan. The clan 
outweighs everything else in your life, 
even the stated law of the land.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of 
the Emerald Enclave, defenders of 
the wild lands.
 Personality Trait. You once ran 
25 miles to warn your clan of an 
approaching threat, and you’d do 
the same again.
 Ideal. To dishonor yourself is to 
dishonor the clan.
 Bond.  Your clan is the most important 
thing in your life, even when they are 
far from you.
 Flaw.  It is nature’s way that the strong 
survive and the weak perish.

a failed save, and half as much damage 
on a successful one.Spells Known:

roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.
 Despite your self-sufficiency, you 
tire of a life alone. Your clan is far, but 
these companions are the closest thing 
to a tribe. As long as they can prove 
themselves worthy of your company, you 
will travel with them.

You grew up in the wilds, a fiercely 
proud member of a noble clan. The clan 
outweighs everything else in your life, 
even the stated law of the land.

memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.

the Emerald Enclave, defenders of 
the wild lands.
 Personality Trait. You once ran 
25 miles to warn your clan of an 
approaching threat, and you’d do 
the same again.
 Ideal. To dishonor yourself is to 
dishonor the clan.
 Bond.  Your clan is the most important 
thing in your life, even when they are 
far from you.

“Could you keep the screaming 
down a bit? I’m kinda busy here.”
You’re completely self-sufficient. If you 
need something, you take it. If someone 
else has it, they don’t anymore. Necessity 
trumps silly laws of possession.
 You weren’t a desperate orphan, 
scratching out a living on the mean 
streets. Neither were you a noble 
poser, slumming for excitement. No, 
you are a master of adaptation to your 
environment—be it urban, dungeon, 
or the wild.
Background (Criminal)
You are an experienced criminal with 
a history of breaking the law. You have 
spent a lot of time among other criminals 
and still have contacts within the 
criminal underworld. You have survived 
up to this point by flouting the rules and 
regulations of society.
 Your expertise is burglary. You are 
unmatched at getting into tight spaces 
and locked rooms, and getting back out 
again richer and none the worse. 
 Criminal Contact. You have a reliable 
and trustworthy contact who acts 
as your liaison to a loose network of 
other criminals. (This is not a formal 
organization like the Zhentarim.) You 
know how to get messages to and from 
your contact, even over great distances, 
using local messnegers, corrupt caravan 
masters, and seedy sailors.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine network of 
spellcasters and spies that seeks to tip 
the scales in favor of the innocent, the 
weak, and the poor.
 Personality Trait. You are always 
calm, no matter what the situation.
 Ideal. Everyone should be free to 
pursue his or her own livelihood.
 Bond.  You are loyal to your friends, not 
to any ideals.
 Flaw.  When you see something 
valuable, you can’t think of anything but 
how to steal it.a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an 
Object action.
Second-Story Work. Climbing does not 
cost you extra movement. In addition, 
when you make a running jump, the 
distance you cover increases by a number 
of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.
Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 2d6 damage to one 
creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
 You don’t need advantage on the 
attack roll if another enemy of the 
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy 
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have 
disadvantage on the attack roll.

“I apologize for cutting off your fascinating diatribe with my blade in your belly. Small talk was 
never my strong suit.”
You have spent decades studying the 
art of combat, refining your skills with relentless vigor. Cunning and patient, your mind plays out each attack and 
counter before you strike for maximum 
effect. Though your magical repertoire is extremely limited, the spells you have chosen enhance your already prodigious ability.
Background (Sage)
You are a serious student of all forms of combat. Despite your studious nature, 
you are aware that there are limits to 
practice and simulation. It is time to conduct some real-world application of your deadly art. Adventuring companions 
are usually the type who will need 
a steady hand and quick wits to bail them out, often. Thankfully, you have both to spare.
 Researcher. If you do not know a piece 
of information, you usually know where 
and from whom that knowledge can be obtained. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. You use polysyllabic 
words that convey the impression of great erudition. Ideal. The path to power and self-
improvement is through knowledge. Bond. Your life’s work is the Tome 
of Battle , a treatise related to your 
theories on combat.
 Flaw.  You speak without really 
thinking through your words, invariably 
insulting others.
High Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.Spellbook

“All things have a spirit within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips. You know four cantrips, 
which you can cast at will. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You 
use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability. Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual 
tag and you have the spell prepared.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

Periapt of Wound Closure
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While you wear this pendant, you 
stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points 
it restores.Druid Features (cont’d)
Wild Shape (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can take a bonus action to magically assume 
the shape of a beast that you have seen 
before, provided that the beast has a challenge rating of 3 or lower. You can use this feature twice.
 You can stay in a beast shape for 2 
hours, and then you revert to your normal 
form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus 
action. You automatically revert if you fall 
unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the 
following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by 
the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and 
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma 
scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addi -
tion to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency 
as you and the bonus in its stat block is 
higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you 
can’t use them.
• When you transform, you assume the 
beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you 
had before you transformed. However, 
if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell 
you’ve already cast, however, or prevent 
you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form 
is physically capable of doing so. 
However, your senses are replaced by those of the beast.
• You choose whether your equipment 
falls to the ground in your space, 
merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a 
piece of equipment, based on the crea -
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment 
doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that

and even talking to dragons. You

as on Intelligence checks to recall 
information about them.

• When you forage, you find twice as 
much food as you normally would.
• While tracking other creatures, you 
also learn their exact number, their 
sizes, and how long ago they passed 
through the area.Elf Ranger 1
“Once I choose my prey, I never 
lose the trail or miss my mark. 
The hunt is all.”
The last remaining member of 
your tribe, you are the epitome 
of the rugged individualist. You know 
better than to ascribe qualities such as 
mercy or bounty to the forests of your 
youth. There are a thousand ways to die 
in the wilderness, and you have survived 
through muscle, wits, and will.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, far from 
civilization and the comforts of town and 
technology. The wilds are in your blood. 
Even in places where you don’t know the 
specific features of the terrain, you know 
the way of the wild.
 Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, a group dedicated to 
maintaining the delicate balance between 
nature and civilization.
 Personality Trait. I once ran twenty-
five miles without stopping to warn my

again if I had to.
 Ideal. Life is like the seasons, 
in constant change, and we must 
change with it.
 Bond.  I am the last of my tribe, and 
it is up to me to ensure their names 
enter legend.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.

Content: Drow Traits
Superior Darkvision. You can see in 
dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Sunlight Sensitivity. You have 
disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
sight when you, the target of your attack, 
or whatever you are trying to perceive is 
in direct sunlight.
Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

Drow Magic. You know the dancing 
lights  cantrip.Drow Rogue 1
“I am in the business of removing 
obstacles.”
Without divine or arcane magical 
ability, your options in the 
cutthroat world of drow society were 
limited. You either became an expert in death, or you died young. After honing your murderous arts in 
the Underdark, you made your escape from the city of your birth to strike out on your own. Your reputation as a nigh-invisible killer strikes fear into those who would wrong you. But those who respect 
you earn your ready support.
Background (Charlatan)
You know what makes people tick, you can tease out their heart’s desires after a 
few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children’s books. Your favorite scheme is putting on new 
identities. Your facility with disguise makes it easy to insinuate yourself into any setting, the better to get your target alone.
 False Identity. You have created 
a second identity that includes 
documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, 
you can forge documents including 
official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you 
are trying to copy.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an organization of well-trained mercenaries, savvy rogues, and crafty warlocks who seek to expand their 
influence and power.
 Personality Trait. You lie about 
almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to. Ideal. You are a free spirit—no one tells 
you what to do.
 Bond. You owe everything to your 
mentor—a master drow assassin who sees your defection as a personal affront. Flaw.  You’re convinced that no 
one could ever fool you the way you fool others.Rogue Features
Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the 
attack roll if another enemy of the 
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy 
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

doubled for any ability check you make using your Perception or Stealth skills.

all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.Elf Fighter 5
“I apologize for cutting off your fascinating diatribe with my blade in your belly. Small talk was 
never my strong suit.”
You have spent decades studying the 
art of combat, refining your skills with relentless vigor. Cunning and patient, your mind plays out each attack and 
counter before you strike for maximum 
effect. Though your magical repertoire is extremely limited, the spells you have chosen enhance your already prodigious ability.
Background (Sage)
You are a serious student of all forms of combat. Despite your studious nature, 
you are aware that there are limits to 
practice and simulation. It is time to conduct some real-world application of your deadly art. Adventuring companions 
are usually the type who will need 
a steady hand and quick wits to bail them out, often. Thankfully, you have both to spare.
 Researcher. If you do not know a piece 
of information, you usually know where 
and from whom that knowledge can be obtained. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. You use polysyllabic 
words that convey the impression of great erudition. Ideal. The path to power and self-
improvement is through knowledge. Bond. Your life’s work is the Tome 
of Battle , a treatise related to your 
theories on combat.
 Flaw.  You speak without really 
thinking through your words, invariably 
insulting others.

from 8 hours of sleep. You may only learn spells of the 
abjuration and evocation schools.

Halfling Nimbleness. You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, 
you can reroll the die and must use 
the new roll.

throws against being frightened.

to hide even when you are obscured 
by a creature that is at least one size 
larger than you.Halfling 
Rogue 2
“Could you keep the screaming 
down a bit? I’m kinda busy here.”
You’re completely self-sufficient. If you 
need something, you take it. If someone 
else has it, they don’t anymore. Necessity 
trumps silly laws of possession.
 You weren’t a desperate orphan, 
scratching out a living on the mean 
streets. Neither were you a noble 
poser, slumming for excitement. No, 
you are a master of adaptation to your 
environment—be it urban, dungeon, 
or the wild.
Background (Criminal)
You are an experienced criminal with 
a history of breaking the law. You have 
spent a lot of time among other criminals 
and still have contacts within the 
criminal underworld. You have survived 
up to this point by flouting the rules and 
regulations of society.
 Your expertise is burglary. You are 
unmatched at getting into tight spaces 
and locked rooms, and getting back out 
again richer and none the worse. 
 Criminal Contact. You have a reliable 
and trustworthy contact who acts 
as your liaison to a loose network of 
other criminals. (This is not a formal 
organization like the Zhentarim.) You 
know how to get messages to and from 
your contact, even over great distances, 
using local messnegers, corrupt caravan 
masters, and seedy sailors.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine network of 
spellcasters and spies that seeks to tip 
the scales in favor of the innocent, the 
weak, and the poor.
 Personality Trait. You are always 
calm, no matter what the situation.
 Ideal. Everyone should be free to 
pursue his or her own livelihood.
 Bond.  You are loyal to your friends, not 
to any ideals.
 Flaw.  When you see something 
valuable, you can’t think of anything but 
how to steal it.Rogue Features
Cunning Action. You can take a bonus 
action on each of your turns in combat, 
only to take the Dash, Disengage, or

creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

Dragon Ancestor.  Whenever you make 
a Charisma check when interacting with 
dragons, your proficiency is doubled if it 
applies to the check.
Draconic Resilience. As magic flows 
through your body, it causes physical 
traits of your dragon ancestor to emerge. 
Your hit point maximum increases by 
1 at 1st level and whenever you gain a 
sorcerer level.
 Additionally, parts of your body are 
covered by a thin sheen of dragon-
like scales. When you aren’t wearing 
armor, your AC equals 13 + your 
Dexterity modifier.
Elemental Affinity.  When you cast a 
spell that deals cold damage, add your 
Charisma modifier to that damage.
Spellcasting. Charisma is your

spells. You use your Charisma whenever 
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
 To cast a spell, you must expend a slot

“Do you hear that? It is the 
roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.
 Despite your self-sufficiency, you 
tire of a life alone. Your clan is far, but 
these companions are the closest thing 
to a tribe. As long as they can prove 
themselves worthy of your company, you 
will travel with them.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, a fiercely

even the stated law of the land.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent

can always recall the general layout of

other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water,

 Faction. You are a member of 
the Emerald Enclave, defenders of

 Personality Trait. You once ran 
25 miles to warn your clan of an 
approaching threat, and you’d do 
the same again.
 Ideal. To dishonor yourself is to 
dishonor the clan.
 Bond.  Your clan is the most important 
thing in your life, even when they are 
far from you.

covered by a thin sheen of dragon-
like scales. When you aren’t wearing

Sorcerer 3
“Do you hear that? It is the 
roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.
 Despite your self-sufficiency, you 
tire of a life alone. Your clan is far, but 
these companions are the closest thing 
to a tribe. As long as they can prove 
themselves worthy of your company, you 
will travel with them.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, a fiercely 
proud member of a noble clan. The clan 
outweighs everything else in your life, 
even the stated law of the land.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of 
the Emerald Enclave, defenders of 
the wild lands.
 Personality Trait. You once ran 
25 miles to warn your clan of an 
approaching threat, and you’d do 
the same again.
 Ideal. To dishonor yourself is to 
dishonor the clan.
 Bond.  Your clan is the most important 
thing in your life, even when they are 
far from you.
 Flaw.  It is nature’s way that the strong 
survive and the weak perish.
Dragonborn Traits
Draconic Ancestry (Silver). You have 
a cold breath weapon and resistance to 
cold damage.

Content: Brave. You have advantage on saving 
throws against being frightened.

to hide even when you are obscured 
by a creature that is at least one size 
larger than you.

action on each of your turns in combat, 
only to take the Dash, Disengage, or 
Hide action.
Fast Hands. You can use the bonus

Rogue 6
“Could you keep the screaming 
down a bit? I’m kinda busy here.”
You’re completely self-sufficient. If you 
need something, you take it. If someone 
else has it, they don’t anymore. Necessity 
trumps silly laws of possession.
 You weren’t a desperate orphan, 
scratching out a living on the mean 
streets. Neither were you a noble 
poser, slumming for excitement. No, 
you are a master of adaptation to your 
environment—be it urban, dungeon, 
or the wild.
Background (Criminal)
You are an experienced criminal with 
a history of breaking the law. You have 
spent a lot of time among other criminals 
and still have contacts within the 
criminal underworld. You have survived 
up to this point by flouting the rules and 
regulations of society.
 Your expertise is burglary. You are 
unmatched at getting into tight spaces 
and locked rooms, and getting back out 
again richer and none the worse. 
 Criminal Contact. You have a reliable 
and trustworthy contact who acts 
as your liaison to a loose network of 
other criminals. (This is not a formal 
organization like the Zhentarim.) You 
know how to get messages to and from 
your contact, even over great distances, 
using local messnegers, corrupt caravan 
masters, and seedy sailors.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine network of 
spellcasters and spies that seeks to tip 
the scales in favor of the innocent, the 
weak, and the poor.
 Personality Trait. You are always 
calm, no matter what the situation.
 Ideal. Everyone should be free to 
pursue his or her own livelihood.
 Bond.  You are loyal to your friends, not 
to any ideals.
 Flaw.  When you see something 
valuable, you can’t think of anything but 
how to steal it.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness. You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, 
you can reroll the die and must use 
the new roll.Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 3d6 damage to one 
creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
 You don’t need advantage on the 
attack roll if another enemy of the 
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy 
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have 
disadvantage on the attack roll.
Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that 
you can see hits you with an attack, you 
can use your reaction to halve the attack’s 
damage against you.

Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.
Cantrip.  You know the true strike cantrip. Elf Fighter 1
“I apologize for cutting off your fascinating diatribe with my blade in your belly. Small talk was 
never my strong suit.”
You have spent decades studying the 
art of combat, refining your skills with relentless vigor. Cunning and patient, your mind plays out each attack and 
counter before you strike for maximum 
effect. Though your magical repertoire is extremely limited, the spells you have chosen enhance your already prodigious ability.
Background (Sage)
You are a serious student of all forms of combat. Despite your studious nature, 
you are aware that there are limits to 
practice and simulation. It is time to conduct some real-world application of your deadly art. Adventuring companions 
are usually the type who will need 
a steady hand and quick wits to bail them out, often. Thankfully, you have both to spare.
 Researcher. If you do not know a piece 
of information, you usually know where 
and from whom that knowledge can be obtained. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. You use polysyllabic 
words that convey the impression of great erudition. Ideal. The path to power and self-
improvement is through knowledge. Bond. Your life’s work is the Tome 
of Battle , a treatise related to your 
theories on combat.
 Flaw.  You speak without really 
thinking through your words, invariably 
insulting others.Fighter Features

wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to

must finish a short or long rest before you

life lived to the fullest.

“I am in the business of removing obstacles.”
Without divine or arcane magical 
ability, your options in the 
cutthroat world of drow society were 
limited. You either became an expert in death, or you died young. After honing your murderous arts in 
the Underdark, you made your escape from the city of your birth to strike out on your own. Your reputation as a nigh-invisible killer strikes fear into those who would wrong you. But those who respect 
you earn your ready support.
Background (Charlatan)
You know what makes people tick, you can tease out their heart’s desires after a

a second identity that includes

are trying to copy.

almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to. Ideal. You are a free spirit—no one tells 
you what to do.

mentor—a master drow assassin who sees your defection as a personal affront. Flaw.  You’re convinced that no 
one could ever fool you the way you fool others.

isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have

using your Perception or Stealth skills.
Assassinate.  You have advantage on 
attack rolls against any creature that 
hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet.

can use your reaction to halve the attack’s 
damage against you.

“Could you keep the screaming 
down a bit? I’m kinda busy here.”
You’re completely self-sufficient. If you 
need something, you take it. If someone 
else has it, they don’t anymore. Necessity 
trumps silly laws of possession.
 You weren’t a desperate orphan, 
scratching out a living on the mean 
streets. Neither were you a noble 
poser, slumming for excitement. No, 
you are a master of adaptation to your 
environment—be it urban, dungeon, 
or the wild.
Background (Criminal)
You are an experienced criminal with 
a history of breaking the law. You have 
spent a lot of time among other criminals 
and still have contacts within the 
criminal underworld. You have survived 
up to this point by flouting the rules and 
regulations of society.
 Your expertise is burglary. You are 
unmatched at getting into tight spaces 
and locked rooms, and getting back out 
again richer and none the worse. 
 Criminal Contact. You have a reliable 
and trustworthy contact who acts 
as your liaison to a loose network of 
other criminals. (This is not a formal 
organization like the Zhentarim.) You 
know how to get messages to and from 
your contact, even over great distances, 
using local messnegers, corrupt caravan 
masters, and seedy sailors.

spellcasters and spies that seeks to tip 
the scales in favor of the innocent, the 
weak, and the poor.

calm, no matter what the situation.

Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 4d6 damage to one

roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.

Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.
Cantrip.  You know the true strike cantrip. Elf Fighter 2
“I apologize for cutting off your fascinating diatribe with my blade in your belly. Small talk was 
never my strong suit.”
You have spent decades studying the 
art of combat, refining your skills with relentless vigor. Cunning and patient, your mind plays out each attack and 
counter before you strike for maximum 
effect. Though your magical repertoire is extremely limited, the spells you have chosen enhance your already prodigious ability.
Background (Sage)
You are a serious student of all forms of combat. Despite your studious nature, 
you are aware that there are limits to 
practice and simulation. It is time to conduct some real-world application of your deadly art. Adventuring companions 
are usually the type who will need 
a steady hand and quick wits to bail them out, often. Thankfully, you have both to spare.
 Researcher. If you do not know a piece 
of information, you usually know where 
and from whom that knowledge can be obtained. Faction. You are a member of the

Content: Ranger Features
Favored Enemy. You have significant 
experience studying, tracking, hunting, 
and even talking to dragons and 
giants. You have advantage on Wisdom 
(Survival) checks to track dragons or 
giants, as well as on Intelligence checks 
to recall information about them.
Natural Explorer. You are particularly 
at home in forest or Underdark terrain. 
When you make an Intelligence or 
Wisdom check related to forest or 
Underdark terrain, your proficiency 
bonus is doubled if you are using a skill 
that you’re proficient in.
 While traveling for an hour or more in 
forest or Underdark terrain, you gain the 
following benefits:
• Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your 
group’s speed.
• Your group can’t become lost except by 
magical means.
• Even when you are engaged in another 
activity while traveling, you remain 
alert to danger.
• If you are traveling alone, you can move 
stealthily at a normal pace.
• When you forage, you find twice as 
much food as you normally would.Elf Ranger 7
“Once I choose my prey, I never 
lose the trail or miss my mark. 
The hunt is all.”
The last remaining member of 
your tribe, you are the epitome 
of the rugged individualist. You know 
better than to ascribe qualities such as 
mercy or bounty to the forests of your 
youth. There are a thousand ways to die 
in the wilderness, and you have survived 
through muscle, wits, and will.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, far from 
civilization and the comforts of town and 
technology. The wilds are in your blood. 
Even in places where you don’t know the 
specific features of the terrain, you know 
the way of the wild.
 Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, a group dedicated to 
maintaining the delicate balance between 
nature and civilization.
 Personality Trait. I once ran twenty-
five miles without stopping to warn my 
clan of an approaching orc horde. I’d do it 
again if I had to.
 Ideal. Life is like the seasons, 
in constant change, and we must 
change with it.
 Bond.  I am the last of my tribe, and 
it is up to me to ensure their names 
enter legend.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.
Wood Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright 
light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Mask of the Wild. You can attempt 
to hide even when you are only lightly 
obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling 
snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.• While tracking other creatures, you 
also learn their exact number, their 
sizes, and how long ago they passed 
through the area.
Fighting Style: Archery. You gain a 
+2 bonus to attack rolls you make with 
ranged weapons. (This is factored into 
the stat block.)
Spellcasting. You have the ability to cast 
spells. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability 
for your ranger spells. You use your 
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your 
spellcasting ability.
 To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.

 Spell Attack Modifier: +6
 Spell Slots: 1st-level (4), 2nd-level (3)
Primeval Awareness. You can use your 
action and expend one ranger spell slot 
to focus your awareness on the region 
around you. For 1 minute per level of 
the spell slot you expend, you can sense 
whether the following types of creatures 
are present within 1 mile of you (or 
within 6 miles of you if you are in forest 
terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, 
elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This Character Name

Content: Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is 
in direct sunlight.
Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Trance. Instead of sleeping, you meditate 
deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day, gaining the same benefit that 
a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
Drow Magic. You know the dancing lights  
cantrip, and you can cast the darkness  
and the faerie fire spell once per day (save 
DC 14). Charisma is your spellcasting 
ability for these spells.
Rogue Features
Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 3d6 damage to one 
creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the

“I am in the business of removing obstacles.”
Without divine or arcane magical 
ability, your options in the 
cutthroat world of drow society were 
limited. You either became an expert in death, or you died young. After honing your murderous arts in 
the Underdark, you made your escape from the city of your birth to strike out on your own. Your reputation as a nigh-invisible killer strikes fear into those who would wrong you. But those who respect 
you earn your ready support.
Background (Charlatan)
You know what makes people tick, you can tease out their heart’s desires after a 
few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children’s books. Your favorite scheme is putting on new 
identities. Your facility with disguise makes it easy to insinuate yourself into any setting, the better to get your target alone.
 False Identity. You have created 
a second identity that includes 
documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, 
you can forge documents including 
official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you 
are trying to copy.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an organization of well-trained mercenaries, savvy rogues, and crafty warlocks who seek to expand their 
influence and power.
 Personality Trait. You lie about 
almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to. Ideal. You are a free spirit—no one tells 
you what to do.
 Bond. You owe everything to your 
mentor—a master drow assassin who sees your defection as a personal affront. Flaw.  You’re convinced that no 
one could ever fool you the way you fool others.
Drow Traits
Superior Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Sunlight Sensitivity. You have 
disadvantage on attack rolls and on target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
Expertise. Your proficiency bonus is 
doubled for any ability check you make using your Deception, Perception, or Stealth skills.
Assassinate.  You have advantage on 
attack rolls against any creature that 
hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet. 
In addition, any hit you score against a 
creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that 
you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s 
damage against you.

“Once I choose my prey, I never 
lose the trail or miss my mark. 
The hunt is all.”
The last remaining member of 
your tribe, you are the epitome 
of the rugged individualist. You know 
better than to ascribe qualities such as 
mercy or bounty to the forests of your 
youth. There are a thousand ways to die

 Ideal. Life is like the seasons, 
in constant change, and we must 
change with it.
 Bond.  I am the last of my tribe, and 
it is up to me to ensure their names 
enter legend.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.

“I apologize for cutting off your fascinating diatribe with my blade in your belly. Small talk was 
never my strong suit.”
You have spent decades studying the 
art of combat, refining your skills with relentless vigor. Cunning and patient, your mind plays out each attack and 
counter before you strike for maximum 
effect. Though your magical repertoire is extremely limited, the spells you have chosen enhance your already prodigious ability.
Background (Sage)
You are a serious student of all forms of combat. Despite your studious nature, 
you are aware that there are limits to 
practice and simulation. It is time to conduct some real-world application of your deadly art. Adventuring companions 
are usually the type who will need 
a steady hand and quick wits to bail them out, often. Thankfully, you have both to spare.
 Researcher. If you do not know a piece 
of information, you usually know where 
and from whom that knowledge can be obtained. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. You use polysyllabic 
words that convey the impression of great erudition. Ideal. The path to power and self-
improvement is through knowledge. Bond. Your life’s work is the Tome 
of Battle , a treatise related to your 
theories on combat.
 Flaw.  You speak without really 
thinking through your words, invariably 
insulting others.
High Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed,

within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.Spellbook

“Could you keep the screaming 
down a bit? I’m kinda busy here.”
You’re completely self-sufficient. If you 
need something, you take it. If someone 
else has it, they don’t anymore. Necessity 
trumps silly laws of possession.
 You weren’t a desperate orphan, 
scratching out a living on the mean 
streets. Neither were you a noble 
poser, slumming for excitement. No, 
you are a master of adaptation to your 
environment—be it urban, dungeon, 
or the wild.
Background (Criminal)
You are an experienced criminal with 
a history of breaking the law. You have 
spent a lot of time among other criminals 
and still have contacts within the 
criminal underworld. You have survived 
up to this point by flouting the rules and 
regulations of society.
 Your expertise is burglary. You are 
unmatched at getting into tight spaces 
and locked rooms, and getting back out 
again richer and none the worse. 
 Criminal Contact. You have a reliable 
and trustworthy contact who acts 
as your liaison to a loose network of 
other criminals. (This is not a formal 
organization like the Zhentarim.) You 
know how to get messages to and from 
your contact, even over great distances, 
using local messnegers, corrupt caravan 
masters, and seedy sailors.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine network of 
spellcasters and spies that seeks to tip 
the scales in favor of the innocent, the 
weak, and the poor.
 Personality Trait. You are always 
calm, no matter what the situation.
 Ideal. Everyone should be free to 
pursue his or her own livelihood.
 Bond.  You are loyal to your friends, not 
to any ideals.
 Flaw.  When you see something 
valuable, you can’t think of anything but 
how to steal it.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness. You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, 
you can reroll the die and must use 
the new roll.Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 2d6 damage to one 
creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
 You don’t need advantage on the 
attack roll if another enemy of the 
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy 
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have 
disadvantage on the attack roll.

Your hit point maximum increases by 
1 at 1st level and whenever you gain a

“Do you hear that? It is the 
roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.
 Despite your self-sufficiency, you 
tire of a life alone. Your clan is far, but 
these companions are the closest thing 
to a tribe. As long as they can prove 
themselves worthy of your company, you

can always recall the general layout of

land offers berries, small game, water,

 Personality Trait. You once ran 
25 miles to warn your clan of an

the same again.
 Ideal. To dishonor yourself is to 
dishonor the clan.

Cleric 3
“Hail pounding cobbled roofs 
into rubble, waves pulverizing rocks 
into pebbles, the crack of trees split by 
lightning, the crash of thunder, making 
the strongest men flinch... was there ever 
a more beautiful symphony?”
You are a worshiper of destructive 
weather: an initiate devoted to the 
wrath of thunder and the divine justice 
of lightning. You may not be the most 
popular priest in your community, but few 
are foolish enough to risk your ire.
Background (Pirate)
Your youth was spent on the high seas, 
as a crewmember on a ship of cutthroats. 
Your devotion to the gods of wrath 
began as simple rituals to ward off harsh 
weather. As you spent more years at sea, 
your bond with the forces of destruction 
grew ever stronger.
 Bad Reputation. No matter where you 
go, people are afraid of you due to your 
reputation. When you are in a civilized 
settlement, you can get away with minor 
criminal offenses.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization 
that seeks to gather economic and 
political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	 You like a job well 
done, especially if you can convince 
someone else to do it.
 Ideal. The sea is freedom–the freedom 
to go anywhere and do anything.
 Bond.  The ship is most important–
crewmates and captains come and go.
 Flaw.  Once someone questions your 
courage, you never back down no matter 
how dangerous the situation.
Cleric Features
Spellcasting Ability. You have the ability 
to cast divine spells. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. 
You use your Wisdom whenever a spell 
refers to your spellcasting ability.

are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the cleric spell list. When you do so, 
choose 6 spells. The spells must be of a 
level for which you have spell slots.
 To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.reactions. For its action, it can use only 
the Dash action or try to escape from 
an effect that prevents it from moving. If 
there’s nowhere to move, the creature can 
use the Dodge action.
Domain: Tempest
Domain Spells. Your clerical domain

Wrath	of	the	Storm.	 When a creature 
within 5 feet of you that you can see hits

reaction to cause the creature to make 
a Dexterity saving throw. The creature 
takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage 
(your choice) on a failed saving throw, 
and half as much damage on a successful 
one. You can use this feature 3 times. You 
regain all expended uses when you finish 
a long rest.

Paladin 3
“No thanks are necessary. I am but a humble servant of the gods. Well, perhaps just one drink.”
You follow the path of righteousness, 
and everyone knows it. Your family 
built chapels to the gods of light and life throughout their lands, and you spread the good word as you travel.
 You move in the highest circles of the 
ruling classes and among the simple 
folk, bringing salvation wherever you go. You vigorously proclaim the virtues of an honorable life, though sometimes 
your audience doesn’t seem to share your 
enthusiasm. But you’re no stick-in-the-mud, and you enjoy the worldly rewards for a job well done.
Background (Noble)
You were born the eighth child of a minor noble family. You are accustomed to privilege and the comforts that come with 
it, but recognizing that you will never 
inherit, you set out as a youth to find your own path.   Position of Privilege. Thanks to your 
noble birth, people are inclined to think 
the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort 
to accommodate you and avoid your 
displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an 
audience with a local noble if you need to.
 Faction. You belong to the Lords’ 
Alliance, whose members ensure the safety and prosperity of civilized folk by standing united against the forces that 
threaten civilization.
 Personality Trait. You are convinced 
that the common folk love you for your kindness and generosity. Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for those beneath you.
 Bond. Your loyalty to your sovereign 
is unswerving. Flaw.  You have an insatiable desire for 
carnal pleasures.
Paladin Features
Divine Sense (3; Recharges after a Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover.  Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit 
points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure 
multiple diseases and neutralize multiple 
poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.
 This feature has no effect on undead 
and constructs.
Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of the following options.
 Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can 
imbue one weapon that you are holding 
with positive energy. For 1 minute, you add a +2 bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon. The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim 
light 10 feet beyond that. If the weapon is 
not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn 
as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. Turn the Unholy.  As an action, you 
present your holy symbol and speak a 
prayer censuring fiends and undead.

Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.
Wizard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the

choose 10 spells. The spells must be of a 
level for which you have spell slots. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.
 You can use an arcane focus as a

spellbook as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.Elf Wizard 6
“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger. Spell Save DC: 15

Evocation
Evocation Savant. The gold and time you 
must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
Sculpt Spells. You can create pockets 
of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can 
choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no 
damage if they would take half damage 
on a successful save.Potent Cantrip. Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt 
of the effect. When a creature succeeds 
on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

“You want to wield power like mine? You want to taste the fire? The price is high, but the flames 
are sweet.”
You made a pact with a fiendish 
entity years ago. They promised you unstoppable power born in the pits of the Nine Hells in exchange for your servitude 
and obeisance.
Background (Hermit)
Your path to power was not always so 
clear. You spent a great deal of time in seclusion, ruminating over whether or not 
it was worth it to continue, or to abandon 
your efforts and default on your debt.	 Discovery. 	The quiet seclusion of your 
extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on 
the campaign.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization that seeks to gather economic and political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	You connect 
everything that happens to you to a grand, cosmic plan.
 Ideal. Emotions must not cloud our 
sense of what is right and true, or our 
logical thinking.	 Bond. Should your discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.
 Flaw.  You would risk too much to 
uncover a lost bit of knowledge.

“Measure twice, cut once. Or two 
or three times, whatever works. Maybe 
five.”
You crave adventure like most people 
crave food or drink. You lived in any 
number of cities and villages during your 
time with the military, but no one place 
has ever truly felt like home–and you 
have slowly come to the conclusion that 
this is according to your preferences. 
Background (Soldier)
You were a professional soldier. You 
traveled to foreign lands, led troops into 
danger, fought wars under the banners 
of different commanders. Yet, you craved 
something more out of life, and resigned 
your commission. Now you are out on 
your own, living by your wits, taking 
orders from no one.
 Military Rank. You were a low-ranked 
officer in a military organization. Soldiers 
loyal to your former military organization 
still recognize your authority and 
influence, and they defer to you if they are 
of a lower rank.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and 
vigilant group that seeks to protect others 
from the depredations of evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can stare down 
a hell hound without flinching.
 Ideal. When people follow orders 
blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
 Bond.  You fight for those who cannot 
fight for themselves.
 Flaw.  You’d rather eat your armor than 
admit when you’re wrong.
Fighter Features
Fighting Style: Protection. When a 
creature you can see attacks a target 
other than you that is within 5 feet of 
you, you can use your reaction to impose 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You must 
be wielding a shield.
Second Wind. On your turn, you can 
use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + 4 hit 
points. Once you use this feature, you 
must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.
Action Surge. On your turn, you can 
take one additional action on top of your 
regular action and a possible bonus 
action.  Once you use this feature, you 
must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.Character Name

Content: Cleric Features
Channel Divinity (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can channel divine energy to create one of the 
following effects. You can do so twice.
 Preserve Life. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore up to 30 hit 
points. Choose any creatures within 30 
feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore 
a creature to no more than half of its 
hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct. Turn Undead. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and speak a prayer 
censuring the undead. Each undead that 
can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become turned for 1 minute or 
until it takes any damage. If the creature 
has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower, it is destroyed instead.Dwarf Cleric 6
“By Moradin’s hammer, be made whole!”
Although you started out as 
an artisan, you heard the 
voice of the dwarven deities 
in the stones you carved and metal you shaped. Your acts of artistry became acts of reverence, causing you 
to desire to exemplify the inner nature of 
your people. You joined the clergy, and your pure dwarven desires allowed you to connect to the divine.
Background  (Guild Jeweler)
Before you became devoted to the dwarven deities, you were a journeyman jeweler and gem cutter. Even outside your 
home, you are recognized by your badge 
and skill. You have the aid of a loose coalition of guilds, and one day you shall 
become a master your own right. Seeking 
such mastery is an act of worship to you. Guild Member. Fellow guild members 
can provide you with necessities, and 
the guild can use its political power to 
aid you. In some areas, a guildhall offers a place to meet other members of your profession and those who aid the guild. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month 
to the guild. If you miss payments, you 
must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lords’ Alliance, a loose coalition of established political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. A perfectionist, you 
demand a lot from yourself and expect 
the most from others. 
 Ideal. It is the duty of civilized people to 
strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization.
 Bond. You aim to prove you are the 
greatest artisan of them all. Flaw.  You are greedy. So you can’t part 
with money easily, and you haggle to get the best possible deal.
Dwarf Features
Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Stonecunning. You have a +6 bonus on 
Intelligence (History) checks related to 
the origin of stonework. A turned creature must spend its turns 
trying to move as far away from you as it 
can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only 
the Dash action or try to escape from 
an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
Life Domain. The Life domain focuses 
on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. You gain a number 
of domain spells, which are always 
considered to be prepared, as a result of this domain. In addition, you have access to the following features:
 Blessed Healer. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher that restores 
hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

“Measure twice, cut once. Or two 
or three times, whatever works. Maybe 
five.”
You crave adventure like most people 
crave food or drink. You lived in any 
number of cities and villages during your 
time with the military, but no one place 
has ever truly felt like home–and you 
have slowly come to the conclusion that 
this is according to your preferences. 
Background (Soldier)
You were a professional soldier. You 
traveled to foreign lands, led troops into 
danger, fought wars under the banners 
of different commanders. Yet, you craved 
something more out of life, and resigned 
your commission. Now you are out on 
your own, living by your wits, taking 
orders from no one.
 Military Rank. You were a low-ranked 
officer in a military organization. Soldiers 
loyal to your former military organization 
still recognize your authority and 
influence, and they defer to you if they are 
of a lower rank.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and 
vigilant group that seeks to protect others 
from the depredations of evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can stare down 
a hell hound without flinching.
 Ideal. When people follow orders 
blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
 Bond.  You fight for those who cannot 
fight for themselves.
 Flaw.  You’d rather eat your armor than 
admit when you’re wrong.
Fighter Features
Fighting Style: Protection. When a 
creature you can see attacks a target 
other than you that is within 5 feet of 
you, you can use your reaction to impose 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You must 
be wielding a shield.
Second Wind. On your turn, you can 
use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + 5 hit 
points. Once you use this feature, you 
must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.
Action Surge. On your turn, you can 
take one additional action on top of your 
regular action and a possible bonus 
action.  Once you use this feature, you 
must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.Character Name

Warlock 3
“You want to wield power like mine? You want to taste the fire? The price is high, but the flames 
are sweet.”
You made a pact with a fiendish 
entity years ago. They promised you unstoppable power born in the pits of the Nine Hells in exchange for your servitude 
and obeisance.
Background (Hermit)
Your path to power was not always so 
clear. You spent a great deal of time in seclusion, ruminating over whether or not 
it was worth it to continue, or to abandon 
your efforts and default on your debt.	 Discovery. 	The quiet seclusion of your 
extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on 
the campaign.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization that seeks to gather economic and political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	You connect 
everything that happens to you to a grand, cosmic plan.
 Ideal. Emotions must not cloud our 
sense of what is right and true, or our 
logical thinking. Bond. Should your discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.
 Flaw.  You would risk too much to 
uncover a lost bit of knowledge.

Spellcasting 	Ability.	You have the ability 
to cast warlock spells. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for your warlock 
spells. You use your Charisma whenever 
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish a 
short or long rest.Invocations
Agonizing Blast. When you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the 
damage it deals on a hit. Note: This has 
already been applied in the stat block.

Content: High Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.
Wizard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the 
ability to cast spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. 
You use your Intelligence whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You prepare the list of wizard spells 
that are available for you to cast. To do so, 
choose 11 spells. The spells must be of a 
level for which you have spell slots. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.
 You can use an arcane focus as a 
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. You can cast any wizard spell in your 
spellbook as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.Elf Wizard 7
“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger. Spell Save DC: 15
 Spell Attack Modifier: +7
 Spell Slots: 1st-level (4), 2nd-level (3), 
3rd-level (3), 4th-level (1)Arcane Recovery. Once per day when 
you finish a short rest, you can choose 
expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than 4.
Arcane Tradition: School of 
Evocation
Evocation Savant. The gold and time you 
must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
Sculpt Spells. You can create pockets 
of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can 
choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no 
damage if they would take half damage 
on a successful save.Potent Cantrip. Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt 
of the effect. When a creature succeeds 
on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

Content: You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow  spell.
 You can use this feature a 
number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.
Divine Smite. When you hit a creature 
with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell slot to deal an 
extra 2d8 radiant damage to the target 
(3d8 radiant damage if it is an undead or a fiend).
Lay on Hands. You have a pool of healing 
power, with which you can restore up to 
10 hit points. This pool replenishes after you finish a long rest. As an action, you can touch a creature 
and draw power from the pool to restore 
a number of hit points to that creature, 
up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit 
points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on 
Hands, expending hit points separately 
for each one. This feature has no effect on undead 
and constructs.Human  
Paladin 2
“No thanks are necessary. I am but a humble servant of the gods. Well, perhaps just one drink.”
You follow the path of righteousness, 
and everyone knows it. Your family 
built chapels to the gods of light and life throughout their lands, and you spread the good word as you travel.
 You move in the highest circles of the 
ruling classes and among the simple 
folk, bringing salvation wherever you go. You vigorously proclaim the virtues of an honorable life, though sometimes 
your audience doesn’t seem to share your 
enthusiasm. But you’re no stick-in-the-mud, and you enjoy the worldly rewards for a job well done.
Background (Noble)
You were born the eighth child of a minor noble family. You are accustomed to privilege and the comforts that come with 
it, but recognizing that you will never 
inherit, you set out as a youth to find your own path.   Position of Privilege. Thanks to your 
noble birth, people are inclined to think 
the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort 
to accommodate you and avoid your 
displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an 
audience with a local noble if you need to.
 Faction. You belong to the Lords’ 
Alliance, whose members ensure the safety and prosperity of civilized folk by standing united against the forces that 
threaten civilization.
 Personality Trait. You are convinced 
that the common folk love you for your kindness and generosity. Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for those beneath you.
 Bond. Your loyalty to your sovereign 
is unswerving. Flaw.  You have an insatiable desire for 
carnal pleasures.
Paladin Features
Divine Sense (3; Recharges after a Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. Protection. When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your 
reaction to impose disadvantage on the 
attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
Spellcasting. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for your paladin 
spells. You use your Charisma whenever 
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.

Content: Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is 
in direct sunlight.
Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Trance. Instead of sleeping, you meditate 
deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day, gaining the same benefit that 
a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
Drow Magic. You know the dancing lights  
cantrip, and you can cast the darkness  
and the faerie fire spell once per day (save 
DC 16). Charisma is your spellcasting 
ability for these spells.
Rogue Features
Evasion. When you are subjected to an 
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, 
you instead take no damage if you 
succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.Drow Rogue 10
“I am in the business of removing obstacles.”
Without divine or arcane magical 
ability, your options in the 
cutthroat world of drow society were 
limited. You either became an expert in death, or you died young. After honing your murderous arts in 
the Underdark, you made your escape from the city of your birth to strike out on your own. Your reputation as a nigh-invisible killer strikes fear into those who would wrong you. But those who respect 
you earn your ready support.
Background (Charlatan)
You know what makes people tick, you can tease out their heart’s desires after a 
few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children’s books. Your favorite scheme is putting on new 
identities. Your facility with disguise makes it easy to insinuate yourself into any setting, the better to get your target alone.
 False Identity. You have created 
a second identity that includes 
documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, 
you can forge documents including 
official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you 
are trying to copy.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an organization of well-trained mercenaries, savvy rogues, and crafty warlocks who seek to expand their 
influence and power.
 Personality Trait. You lie about 
almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to. Ideal. You are a free spirit—no one tells 
you what to do.
 Bond. You owe everything to your 
mentor—a master drow assassin who sees your defection as a personal affront. Flaw.  You’re convinced that no 
one could ever fool you the way you fool others.
Drow Traits
Superior Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Sunlight Sensitivity. You have 
disadvantage on attack rolls and on Infiltration Expertise.  You can 
unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profression, and affiliations for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that belongs to 
someone else. Thereafter, if you adopt 
the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.
Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 5d6 damage to one 
creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the 
attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy 
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have 
disadvantage on the attack roll.
Expertise. Your proficiency bonus is 
doubled for any ability check you make 
using your Deception, Perception, or 
Stealth skills.

“Could you keep the screaming 
down a bit? I’m kinda busy here.”
You’re completely self-sufficient. If you 
need something, you take it. If someone 
else has it, they don’t anymore. Necessity 
trumps silly laws of possession.
 You weren’t a desperate orphan, 
scratching out a living on the mean 
streets. Neither were you a noble 
poser, slumming for excitement. No, 
you are a master of adaptation to your 
environment—be it urban, dungeon, 
or the wild.
Background (Criminal)
You are an experienced criminal with 
a history of breaking the law. You have 
spent a lot of time among other criminals 
and still have contacts within the 
criminal underworld. You have survived 
up to this point by flouting the rules and 
regulations of society.
 Your expertise is burglary. You are 
unmatched at getting into tight spaces 
and locked rooms, and getting back out 
again richer and none the worse. 
 Criminal Contact. You have a reliable 
and trustworthy contact who acts 
as your liaison to a loose network of 
other criminals. (This is not a formal 
organization like the Zhentarim.) You 
know how to get messages to and from 
your contact, even over great distances, 
using local messnegers, corrupt caravan 
masters, and seedy sailors.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine network of 
spellcasters and spies that seeks to tip 
the scales in favor of the innocent, the 
weak, and the poor.
 Personality Trait. You are always 
calm, no matter what the situation.
 Ideal. Everyone should be free to 
pursue his or her own livelihood.
 Bond.  You are loyal to your friends, not 
to any ideals.
 Flaw.  When you see something 
valuable, you can’t think of anything but 
how to steal it.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness. You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, 
you can reroll the die and must use

Second-Story Work. Climbing does not 
cost you extra movement. In addition, 
when you make a running jump, the 
distance you cover increases by a number 
of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.
Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 5d6 damage to one 
creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
 You don’t need advantage on the 
attack roll if another enemy of the 
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy 
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have 
disadvantage on the attack roll.

“Hail pounding cobbled roofs 
into rubble, waves pulverizing rocks 
into pebbles, the crack of trees split by 
lightning, the crash of thunder, making 
the strongest men flinch... was there ever 
a more beautiful symphony?”
You are a worshiper of destructive 
weather: an initiate devoted to the 
wrath of thunder and the divine justice 
of lightning. You may not be the most 
popular priest in your community, but few 
are foolish enough to risk your ire.
Background (Pirate)
Your youth was spent on the high seas, 
as a crewmember on a ship of cutthroats. 
Your devotion to the gods of wrath 
began as simple rituals to ward off harsh 
weather. As you spent more years at sea, 
your bond with the forces of destruction 
grew ever stronger.
 Bad Reputation. No matter where you 
go, people are afraid of you due to your 
reputation. When you are in a civilized 
settlement, you can get away with minor 
criminal offenses.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization 
that seeks to gather economic and 
political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	 You like a job well 
done, especially if you can convince 
someone else to do it.
 Ideal. The sea is freedom–the freedom 
to go anywhere and do anything.
 Bond.  The ship is most important–
crewmates and captains come and go.
 Flaw.  Once someone questions your 
courage, you never back down no matter 
how dangerous the situation.

choose 5 spells. The spells must be of a

Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the 
cruel and wicked, especially those who 
harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.
Background (Acolyte)

monastery dedicated to the Triad—Torm, 
Tyr, and primarily for your order, Ilmater, 
god of endurance and martyrdom. As 
a priest, you can perform sacred rites, 
including counseling and aiding others.
 Shelter of the Faithful. You and your 
companions can receive aid at any site 
dedicated to the Triad or its member 
deities, especially Ilmater. You must 
provide any material components for 
spells cast on your behalf. Those who 
share your religion support you at a 
modest lifestyle.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, seekers of justice 
who protect others from evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can find 
common ground between the fiercest 
enemies, empathizing with them and 
always working toward peace.
 Ideal. You always try to help those in 
need, no matter what the personal cost.
 Bond.  Everything you do is to protect 
the common folk.
 Flaw.  You place too much trust in those 
who profess to share your faith.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness.  You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack

can reroll the die and use the new roll.

these attacks, you can impose one of the

“It seems I struck a chord. Ha! I 
love that one.”
The life of a vagabond is the 
only life you’ve ever known, and 
your various talents have rarely failed to 
provide you a warm bed and a hot supper. 
But mere survival is not enough anymore. 
You have discovered the hidden magic of 
words and music, and it is time for you 
to weave yourself into the stories told 
in hushed tones over steaming drinks, 
inspiring wonder in their listeners.
Background (Entertainer)
You have been the center of attention 
since before you could walk, and once 
you learned to sing and play, you never 
surrendered the spotlight again. And who 
deserves it more than you?
 By Popular Demand. You can always 
find a place to perform. You receive 
free lodging and food of a modest or 
comfortable standard as long as you 
perform each night. When strangers 
recognize you in a town where you 
have performed, they typically take a 
liking to you.

work against tyranny through the sharing 
of information and lore.

mood or your mind as quickly as you 
change key in a song.

yourself superior to your hated rival.

light. You can’t discern color in darkness,

from 8 hours of sleep.
Wizard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the

You use your Intelligence whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You prepare the list of wizard spells 
that are available for you to cast. To do so, 
choose 9 spells. The spells must be of a 
level for which you have spell slots. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish

“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger. Spell Save DC: 15

Arcane Tradition: School of 
Evocation
Evocation Savant. The gold and time you 
must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
Sculpt Spells. You can create pockets 
of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can 
choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no 
damage if they would take half damage 
on a successful save.

“You want to wield power like mine? You want to taste the fire? The price is high, but the flames 
are sweet.”
You made a pact with a fiendish 
entity years ago. They promised you unstoppable power born in the pits of the Nine Hells in exchange for your servitude 
and obeisance.
Background (Hermit)
Your path to power was not always so 
clear. You spent a great deal of time in seclusion, ruminating over whether or not 
it was worth it to continue, or to abandon 
your efforts and default on your debt.	 Discovery. 	The quiet seclusion of your 
extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on 
the campaign.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization that seeks to gather economic and political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	You connect 
everything that happens to you to a grand, cosmic plan.
 Ideal. Emotions must not cloud our 
sense of what is right and true, or our 
logical thinking.	 Bond. Should your discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.
 Flaw.  You would risk too much to 
uncover a lost bit of knowledge.

Spellcasting Ability. You have the ability 
to cast arcane spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. Elf Fighter 10
“I apologize for cutting off your fascinating diatribe with my blade in your belly. Small talk was 
never my strong suit.”
You have spent decades studying the 
art of combat, refining your skills with relentless vigor. Cunning and patient, your mind plays out each attack and 
counter before you strike for maximum 
effect. Though your magical repertoire is extremely limited, the spells you have chosen enhance your already prodigious ability.
Background (Sage)
You are a serious student of all forms of combat. Despite your studious nature, 
you are aware that there are limits to 
practice and simulation. It is time to conduct some real-world application of your deadly art. Adventuring companions 
are usually the type who will need 
a steady hand and quick wits to bail them out, often. Thankfully, you have both to spare.
 Researcher. If you do not know a piece 
of information, you usually know where 
and from whom that knowledge can be obtained. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. You use polysyllabic 
words that convey the impression of great erudition. Ideal. The path to power and self-
improvement is through knowledge. Bond. Your life’s work is the Tome 
of Battle , a treatise related to your 
theories on combat.
 Flaw.  You speak without really 
thinking through your words, invariably 
insulting others.
High Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.You use your Intelligence whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You may only learn spells of the 
abjuration and evocation schools.

Barbarian 8
“The wild is in my blood.”
Hailing from the northern 
lands, you are a stranger to 
civilization. Yet you travel 
wherever need guides you,  
fighting those who would despoil the 
wilderness. You have faced encroaching 
evil from monsters to greedy humans. 
You take what you need, and feed the 
ground with the blood of such enemies.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up among tribal nomads, 
far from civilization and its comforts. 
You’ve hunted great herds, survived 
extreme weather, raided the trade of 
softer folk, and protected places sacred 
to your people. At times, you’ve enjoyed 
the solitude of being the only sentient 
creature for miles in any direction. Even 
in places where the terrain is new, you 
know the ways of the wild.
 Wanderer. As a former barbarian 
nomad and raider, you have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers enough.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats.
 Personality Trait. You place no stock 
in refined manners or wealth.
 Ideal. Life is constant change, and you 
must change with it to survive.
 Bond.  You take the despoiling of 
the wilderness and sacred sites as a 
personal insult.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.
Barbarian Features
Danger Sense.  You have advantage on 
Dexterity saving throws against effects 
that you can see. To gain this benefit, 
you can’t be blinded, deafened, or 
incapacitated.
Fast Movement.  Your speed increases 
by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing 
heavy armor.• You can’t cast or concentrate on spells.
 Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends 
early if you are knocked unconscious or if 
your turn ends and you haven’t attacked 
a hostile creature since your last turn or 
taken damage since then. You can also 
end your rage as a bonus action.
Reckless Attack. When you make your 
first attack on your turn, you can decide 
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you 
advantage on melee weapon attack rolls 
using Strength during this turn, but 
attack rolls against you have advantage 
until your next turn.
Unarmored Defense. While you are 
wearing no armor, but even if you’re 
using a shield, your Armor Class equals 
10 + your Dexterity modifier + your 
Constitution modifier.Character Name

“Measure twice, cut once. Or two 
or three times, whatever works. Maybe 
five.”
You crave adventure like most people 
crave food or drink. You lived in any 
number of cities and villages during your 
time with the military, but no one place 
has ever truly felt like home–and you 
have slowly come to the conclusion that 
this is according to your preferences. 
Background (Soldier)
You were a professional soldier. You 
traveled to foreign lands, led troops into 
danger, fought wars under the banners 
of different commanders. Yet, you craved 
something more out of life, and resigned 
your commission. Now you are out on 
your own, living by your wits, taking 
orders from no one.
 Military Rank. You were a low-ranked 
officer in a military organization. Soldiers 
loyal to your former military organization 
still recognize your authority and 
influence, and they defer to you if they are 
of a lower rank.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and 
vigilant group that seeks to protect others 
from the depredations of evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can stare down 
a hell hound without flinching.
 Ideal. When people follow orders 
blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
 Bond.  You fight for those who cannot 
fight for themselves.
 Flaw.  You’d rather eat your armor than 
admit when you’re wrong.
Fighter Features
Fighting Style: Protection. When a 
creature you can see attacks a target 
other than you that is within 5 feet of 
you, you can use your reaction to impose

use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + 7 hit

must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.

Channel Divinity (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can channel divine energy to create one of the 
following effects. You can do so once.
 Preserve Life. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore up to 25 hit 
points. Choose any creatures within 30 
feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore 
a creature to no more than half of its 
hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct. Turn Undead. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and speak a prayer 
censuring the undead. Each undead that 
can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become turned for 1 minute or 
until it takes any damage. If the creature 
has a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower, it is destroyed instead.Dwarf Cleric 5
“By Moradin’s hammer, be made whole!”
Although you started out as 
an artisan, you heard the 
voice of the dwarven deities 
in the stones you carved and metal you shaped. Your acts of artistry became acts of reverence, causing you 
to desire to exemplify the inner nature of 
your people. You joined the clergy, and your pure dwarven desires allowed you to connect to the divine.
Background  (Guild Jeweler)
Before you became devoted to the dwarven deities, you were a journeyman jeweler and gem cutter. Even outside your 
home, you are recognized by your badge 
and skill. You have the aid of a loose coalition of guilds, and one day you shall 
become a master your own right. Seeking 
such mastery is an act of worship to you. Guild Member. Fellow guild members 
can provide you with necessities, and 
the guild can use its political power to 
aid you. In some areas, a guildhall offers a place to meet other members of your profession and those who aid the guild. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month 
to the guild. If you miss payments, you 
must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lords’ Alliance, a loose coalition of established political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. A perfectionist, you 
demand a lot from yourself and expect 
the most from others. 
 Ideal. It is the duty of civilized people to 
strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization.
 Bond. You aim to prove you are the 
greatest artisan of them all. Flaw.  You are greedy. So you can’t part 
with money easily, and you haggle to get the best possible deal.
Dwarf Features
Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Stonecunning. You have a +6 bonus on 
Intelligence (History) checks related to 
the origin of stonework. A turned creature must spend its turns 
trying to move as far away from you as it 
can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only 
the Dash action or try to escape from 
an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
Life Domain. The Life domain focuses 
on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. You gain a number 
of domain spells, which are always 
considered to be prepared, as a result of this domain. In addition, you have access to the following features:
 Disciple of Life. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit 
points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will.
 Cantrips. You know four cantrips, 
which you can cast at will.
 Preparing and Casting Spells. To cast 
one of your cleric spells, you must expend 
a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You 
regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the cleric spell list. When you do so, 
choose up to nine cleric spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. When 
you prepare new spells, you must pray for 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
 Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your cleric 
spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion to the dwarven deities, 
especially Moradin. You use your 
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Ritual Casting. You can cast a cleric 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual 
tag and you have the spell prepared.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a holy 
symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

--- Chunk 104 ---
Content: Cleric Features
Channel Divinity (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can channel divine energy to create one of the 
following effects. You can do so once.
 Preserve Life. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore up to 20 hit 
points. Choose any creatures within 30 
feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore 
a creature to no more than half of its 
hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct. Turn Undead. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and speak a prayer 
censuring the undead. Each undead that 
can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become turned for 1 minute or 
until it takes any damage.
 A turned creature must spend its turns 
trying to move as far away from you as it Dwarf Cleric 4
“By Moradin’s hammer, be made whole!”
Although you started out as 
an artisan, you heard the 
voice of the dwarven deities 
in the stones you carved and metal you shaped. Your acts of artistry became acts of reverence, causing you 
to desire to exemplify the inner nature of 
your people. You joined the clergy, and your pure dwarven desires allowed you to connect to the divine.
Background  (Guild Jeweler)
Before you became devoted to the dwarven deities, you were a journeyman jeweler and gem cutter. Even outside your 
home, you are recognized by your badge 
and skill. You have the aid of a loose coalition of guilds, and one day you shall 
become a master your own right. Seeking 
such mastery is an act of worship to you. Guild Member. Fellow guild members 
can provide you with necessities, and 
the guild can use its political power to 
aid you. In some areas, a guildhall offers a place to meet other members of your profession and those who aid the guild. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month 
to the guild. If you miss payments, you 
must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lords’ Alliance, a loose coalition of established political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. A perfectionist, you 
demand a lot from yourself and expect 
the most from others. 
 Ideal. It is the duty of civilized people to 
strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization.
 Bond. You aim to prove you are the 
greatest artisan of them all. Flaw.  You are greedy. So you can’t part 
with money easily, and you haggle to get the best possible deal.
Dwarf Features
Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Stonecunning. You have a +4 bonus on 
Intelligence (History) checks related to 
the origin of stonework.can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take 
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If 
there’s nowhere to move, the creature can 
use the Dodge action.
Life Domain. The Life domain focuses 
on the vibrant positive energy—one of 
the fundamental forces of the universe—
that sustains all life. You gain a number of domain spells, which are always considered to be prepared, as a result of 
this domain. In addition, you have access 
to the following features: Disciple of Life. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit 
points to a creature, the creature regains 
additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

“Measure twice, cut once. Or two 
or three times, whatever works. Maybe 
five.”
You crave adventure like most people 
crave food or drink. You lived in any 
number of cities and villages during your 
time with the military, but no one place 
has ever truly felt like home–and you 
have slowly come to the conclusion that 
this is according to your preferences. 
Background (Soldier)
You were a professional soldier. You 
traveled to foreign lands, led troops into 
danger, fought wars under the banners 
of different commanders. Yet, you craved 
something more out of life, and resigned 
your commission. Now you are out on 
your own, living by your wits, taking 
orders from no one.
 Military Rank. You were a low-ranked 
officer in a military organization. Soldiers 
loyal to your former military organization 
still recognize your authority and 
influence, and they defer to you if they are 
of a lower rank.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and 
vigilant group that seeks to protect others 
from the depredations of evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can stare down 
a hell hound without flinching.
 Ideal. When people follow orders 
blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
 Bond.  You fight for those who cannot 
fight for themselves.
 Flaw.  You’d rather eat your armor than 
admit when you’re wrong.
Fighter Features
Fighting Style: Protection. When a 
creature you can see attacks a target 
other than you that is within 5 feet of 
you, you can use your reaction to impose 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You must 
be wielding a shield.
Second Wind. On your turn, you can 
use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + 6 hit 
points. Once you use this feature, you 
must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.
Action Surge. On your turn, you can 
take one additional action on top of your

Content: Feral Instinct.  You have advantage on 
initiative rolls. Additionally, if you are 
surprised at the beginning of combat and 
aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally 
on your first turn if you enter your rage 
before doing anything else on that turn.
Rage (Recharges after You Finish a 
Long Rest). Four times, you can enter a 
rage as a bonus action. While raging, the 
following parameters apply:
• You have advantage on Strength checks 
and Strength saving throws.
• When you make a melee weapon attack 
using Strength, you gain a +3 bonus to 
the damage roll.
• You have resistance to bludgeoning, 
piercing, and slashing damage.
• You can’t be frightened or charmed. 
If you are already frightened or 
charmed, you ignore those conditions 
while you rage.
• You can make a single melee weapon 
attack as a bonus action. If you do so, 
when your rage ends, you suffer one 
level of exhaustion.Human  
Barbarian 9
“The wild is in my blood.”
Hailing from the northern 
lands, you are a stranger to 
civilization. Yet you travel 
wherever need guides you,  
fighting those who would despoil the 
wilderness. You have faced encroaching 
evil from monsters to greedy humans. 
You take what you need, and feed the 
ground with the blood of such enemies.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up among tribal nomads, 
far from civilization and its comforts. 
You’ve hunted great herds, survived 
extreme weather, raided the trade of 
softer folk, and protected places sacred 
to your people. At times, you’ve enjoyed 
the solitude of being the only sentient 
creature for miles in any direction. Even 
in places where the terrain is new, you 
know the ways of the wild.
 Wanderer. As a former barbarian 
nomad and raider, you have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers enough.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats.
 Personality Trait. You place no stock 
in refined manners or wealth.
 Ideal. Life is constant change, and you 
must change with it to survive.
 Bond.  You take the despoiling of 
the wilderness and sacred sites as a 
personal insult.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.
Barbarian Features
Brutal Critical. When rolling the extra 
damage for a critical hit with a melee 
attack you can roll one additional 
weapon damage die.
Danger Sense.  You have advantage on 
Dexterity saving throws against effects 
that you can see. To gain this benefit, 
you can’t be blinded, deafened, or 
incapacitated.
Fast Movement.  Your speed increases 
by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing 
heavy armor.• You can’t cast or concentrate on spells.
 Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends 
early if you are knocked unconscious or if 
your turn ends and you haven’t attacked 
a hostile creature since your last turn or 
taken damage since then. You can also 
end your rage as a bonus action.
Reckless Attack. When you make your 
first attack on your turn, you can decide 
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you 
advantage on melee weapon attack rolls 
using Strength during this turn, but 
attack rolls against you have advantage 
until your next turn.
Unarmored Defense. While you are 
wearing no armor, but even if you’re 
using a shield, your Armor Class equals 
10 + your Dexterity modifier + your 
Constitution modifier.Character Name

“It seems I struck a chord. Ha! I 
love that one.”
The life of a vagabond is the 
only life you’ve ever known, and 
your various talents have rarely failed to 
provide you a warm bed and a hot supper. 
But mere survival is not enough anymore. 
You have discovered the hidden magic of 
words and music, and it is time for you 
to weave yourself into the stories told 
in hushed tones over steaming drinks, 
inspiring wonder in their listeners.
Background (Entertainer)
You have been the center of attention 
since before you could walk, and once 
you learned to sing and play, you never 
surrendered the spotlight again. And who 
deserves it more than you?

find a place to perform. You receive

liking to you.

work against tyranny through the sharing 
of information and lore.

Content: High Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.
Wizard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the 
ability to cast spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
 You prepare the list of wizard spells 
that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose 8 spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
 You can use an arcane focus as a 
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
 You can cast any wizard spell in your 
spellbook as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.Elf Wizard 4
“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger. Spell Save DC: 14
 Spell Attack Modifier: +6
 Spell Slots: 1st-level (4), 2nd-level (3)
Arcane Recovery. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to 
or less than 2.
Arcane Tradition: School of 
Evocation
Evocation Savant. The gold and time you 
must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
Sculpt Spells. You can create pockets 
of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can 
choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no 
damage if they would take half damage 
on a successful save.

Lay on Hands. You have a pool of healing 
power, with which you can restore up to 5 hit points. This pool replenishes after you

 As an action, you can touch a creature 
and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, 
up to the maximum amount remaining 
in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit

“No thanks are necessary. I 
am but a humble servant of the gods. Well, perhaps just one drink.”
You follow the path of righteousness, 
and everyone knows it. Your family 
built chapels to the gods of light and life throughout their lands, and you spread the good word as you travel.
 You move in the highest circles of the 
ruling classes and among the simple 
folk, bringing salvation wherever you go. You vigorously proclaim the virtues of an honorable life, though sometimes 
your audience doesn’t seem to share your 
enthusiasm. But you’re no stick-in-the-mud, and you enjoy the worldly rewards for a job well done.

it, but recognizing that you will never 
inherit, you set out as a youth to find your own path.   Position of Privilege. Thanks to your 
noble birth, people are inclined to think 
the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort

“Hail pounding cobbled roofs 
into rubble, waves pulverizing rocks 
into pebbles, the crack of trees split by 
lightning, the crash of thunder, making 
the strongest men flinch... was there ever 
a more beautiful symphony?”
You are a worshiper of destructive

of lightning. You may not be the most 
popular priest in your community, but few 
are foolish enough to risk your ire.

“Hail pounding cobbled roofs 
into rubble, waves pulverizing rocks

a more beautiful symphony?”
You are a worshiper of destructive

wrath of thunder and the divine justice 
of lightning. You may not be the most 
popular priest in your community, but few 
are foolish enough to risk your ire.
Background (Pirate)
Your youth was spent on the high seas,

your bond with the forces of destruction 
grew ever stronger.
 Bad Reputation. No matter where you

reputation. When you are in a civilized 
settlement, you can get away with minor 
criminal offenses.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization 
that seeks to gather economic and 
political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	 You like a job well

someone else to do it.
 Ideal. The sea is freedom–the freedom 
to go anywhere and do anything.

from the cleric spell list. When you do so, 
choose 15 spells. The spells must be of a 
level for which you have spell slots.

of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute 
or until it takes any damage.
 A turned creature must spend its turns 
trying to move as far away from you as it 
can, and it can’t willingly move to a space 
within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take 
reactions. For its action, it can use only 
the Dash action or try to escape from 
an effect that prevents it from moving. If 
there’s nowhere to move, the creature can 
use the Dodge action.
Destroy	Undead.	 When an undead 
fails its saving throw against your Turn

destroyed if its challenge rating is at 
or below CR 1.

assistance you seek, then roll percentile 
dice. If you roll a number equal to or 
lower than your cleric level, your deity

of the intervention; the effect of any 
cleric spell or domain spell would be 
appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you 
can’t use this feature again for 7 days.

Monk 9
“Size	of	the	body	indicates	
nothing	of	the	depth	of	the	spirit.”
Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the 
cruel and wicked, especially those who 
harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.
Background (Acolyte)
You spent your formative years in a 
monastery dedicated to the Triad—Torm, 
Tyr, and primarily for your order, Ilmater, 
god of endurance and martyrdom. As 
a priest, you can perform sacred rites, 
including counseling and aiding others.
 Shelter of the Faithful. You and your 
companions can receive aid at any site 
dedicated to the Triad or its member 
deities, especially Ilmater. You must 
provide any material components for 
spells cast on your behalf. Those who 
share your religion support you at a 
modest lifestyle.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, seekers of justice 
who protect others from evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can find 
common ground between the fiercest 
enemies, empathizing with them and 
always working toward peace.
 Ideal. You always try to help those in 
need, no matter what the personal cost.
 Bond.  Everything you do is to protect 
the common folk.
 Flaw.  You place too much trust in those 
who profess to share your faith.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness.  You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, you 
can reroll the die and use the new roll.
Monk Features
Evasion. When you are subjected to an 
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity 
saving throw to take only half damage, 
you instead take no damage if you 
succeed on the saving throw, and only 
half damage if you fail. Whenever you hit a creature with one of 
these attacks, you can impose one of the 
following three effects on that target:
• It must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity 
saving throw or be knocked prone.
• It must succeed on a DC 14 Strength 
saving throw, or you can push it up to 
15 feet away from you.
• It can’t take reactions until the end of 
your next turn.
	 Patient	Defense.  You can spend 1 
ki point to take the Dodge action as a 
bonus action.
	 Step	of	the	Wind.	 You can spend 
1 ki point to take the Disengage or 
Dash action as a bonus action. If you 
do so, your jump distance is doubled 
for the turn.
	 Stunning	Strike.	 When you hit another 
creature with a melee weapon attack, 
you can spend 1 ki point. If you do so, 
the target must succeed on a DC 14 
Constitution saving throw or be stunned 
until the end of your next turn.Character Name

a number of hit points to that creature, 
up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.Human  
Paladin 5
“No thanks are necessary. I am but a humble servant of the gods. Well, perhaps just one drink.”
You follow the path of righteousness, 
and everyone knows it. Your family 
built chapels to the gods of light and life throughout their lands, and you spread the good word as you travel.
 You move in the highest circles of the 
ruling classes and among the simple 
folk, bringing salvation wherever you go. You vigorously proclaim the virtues of an honorable life, though sometimes 
your audience doesn’t seem to share your 
enthusiasm. But you’re no stick-in-the-mud, and you enjoy the worldly rewards for a job well done.
Background (Noble)
You were born the eighth child of a minor noble family. You are accustomed to privilege and the comforts that come with 
it, but recognizing that you will never 
inherit, you set out as a youth to find your own path.   Position of Privilege. Thanks to your 
noble birth, people are inclined to think 
the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort 
to accommodate you and avoid your 
displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an 
audience with a local noble if you need to.
 Faction. You belong to the Lords’ 
Alliance, whose members ensure the safety and prosperity of civilized folk by standing united against the forces that 
threaten civilization.
 Personality Trait. You are convinced 
that the common folk love you for your kindness and generosity. Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for those beneath you.
 Bond. Your loyalty to your sovereign 
is unswerving. Flaw.  You have an insatiable desire for 
carnal pleasures.
Paladin Features

your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover.  Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit 
points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure 
multiple diseases and neutralize multiple 
poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. This feature has no effect on undead 
and constructs.
Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of the following options.
 Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can 
imbue one weapon that you are holding 
with positive energy. For 1 minute, you add a +3 bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon. The weapon also emits 
bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim 
light 10 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.
 You can end this effect on your turn 
as part of any other action. If you are no 
longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. Turn the Unholy.  As an action, you 
present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead.

“You want to wield power like mine? You want to taste the fire? The price is high, but the flames 
are sweet.”
You made a pact with a fiendish 
entity years ago. They promised you unstoppable power born in the pits of the Nine Hells in exchange for your servitude 
and obeisance.
Background (Hermit)
Your path to power was not always so 
clear. You spent a great deal of time in seclusion, ruminating over whether or not 
it was worth it to continue, or to abandon 
your efforts and default on your debt.	 Discovery. 	The quiet seclusion of your 
extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on 
the campaign.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization that seeks to gather economic and political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.

everything that happens to you to a grand, cosmic plan.
 Ideal. Emotions must not cloud our 
sense of what is right and true, or our 
logical thinking. Bond. Should your discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.

uncover a lost bit of knowledge.

Fighter 2
“Measure twice, cut once. Or two 
or three times, whatever works. Maybe 
five.”
You crave adventure like most people 
crave food or drink. You lived in any 
number of cities and villages during your 
time with the military, but no one place 
has ever truly felt like home–and you 
have slowly come to the conclusion that 
this is according to your preferences. 
Background (Soldier)
You were a professional soldier. You 
traveled to foreign lands, led troops into 
danger, fought wars under the banners 
of different commanders. Yet, you craved 
something more out of life, and resigned 
your commission. Now you are out on 
your own, living by your wits, taking 
orders from no one.
 Military Rank. You were a low-ranked 
officer in a military organization. Soldiers 
loyal to your former military organization 
still recognize your authority and 
influence, and they defer to you if they are 
of a lower rank.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and 
vigilant group that seeks to protect others 
from the depredations of evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can stare down 
a hell hound without flinching.
 Ideal. When people follow orders 
blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
 Bond.  You fight for those who cannot 
fight for themselves.
 Flaw.  You’d rather eat your armor than 
admit when you’re wrong.
Fighter Features
Fighting Style: Protection. When a 
creature you can see attacks a target 
other than you that is within 5 feet of 
you, you can use your reaction to impose 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You must 
be wielding a shield.
Second Wind. On your turn, you can 
use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + 2 hit 
points. Once you use this feature, you 
must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.
Action Surge. On your turn, you can 
take one additional action on top of your

Content: Cleric Features
Life Domain. The Life domain focuses 
on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—
that sustains all life. You gain a number 
of domain spells, which are always considered to be prepared, as a result of this domain. In addition, you have access 
to the following features:
 Disciple of Life. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips. You know three cantrips, 
which you can cast at will.
 Preparing and Casting Spells. To cast 
one of your cleric spells, you must expend 
a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest.Dwarf Cleric 1
“By Moradin’s hammer, be 
made whole!”
Although you started out as 
an artisan, you heard the 
voice of the dwarven deities 
in the stones you carved and metal you shaped. Your acts of artistry became acts of reverence, causing you 
to desire to exemplify the inner nature of 
your people. You joined the clergy, and your pure dwarven desires allowed you to connect to the divine.
Background  (Guild Jeweler)
Before you became devoted to the dwarven deities, you were a journeyman jeweler and gem cutter. Even outside your 
home, you are recognized by your badge 
and skill. You have the aid of a loose coalition of guilds, and one day you shall 
become a master your own right. Seeking 
such mastery is an act of worship to you. Guild Member. Fellow guild members 
can provide you with necessities, and 
the guild can use its political power to 
aid you. In some areas, a guildhall offers a place to meet other members of your profession and those who aid the guild. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month 
to the guild. If you miss payments, you 
must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lords’ Alliance, a loose coalition of established political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. A perfectionist, you 
demand a lot from yourself and expect 
the most from others. 
 Ideal. It is the duty of civilized people to 
strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization.
 Bond. You aim to prove you are the 
greatest artisan of them all. Flaw.  You are greedy. So you can’t part 
with money easily, and you haggle to get the best possible deal.
Dwarf Features
Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Stonecunning. You have a +4 bonus on 
Intelligence (History) checks related to 
the origin of stonework. You prepare the list of cleric spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose up to four cleric spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have 
spell slots.
 You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. When you prepare new spells, you must pray 
for 1 minute per spell level for each spell 
on your list. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion to the dwarven deities, 
especially Moradin. You use your 
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Ritual Casting. You can cast a cleric 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual 
tag and you have the spell prepared.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a holy 
symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

“Measure twice, cut once. Or two 
or three times, whatever works. Maybe 
five.”
You crave adventure like most people 
crave food or drink. You lived in any 
number of cities and villages during your 
time with the military, but no one place 
has ever truly felt like home–and you 
have slowly come to the conclusion that 
this is according to your preferences. 
Background (Soldier)
You were a professional soldier. You 
traveled to foreign lands, led troops into 
danger, fought wars under the banners 
of different commanders. Yet, you craved 
something more out of life, and resigned 
your commission. Now you are out on 
your own, living by your wits, taking 
orders from no one.
 Military Rank. You were a low-ranked 
officer in a military organization. Soldiers 
loyal to your former military organization 
still recognize your authority and 
influence, and they defer to you if they are 
of a lower rank.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and 
vigilant group that seeks to protect others 
from the depredations of evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can stare down 
a hell hound without flinching.
 Ideal. When people follow orders 
blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
 Bond.  You fight for those who cannot 
fight for themselves.
 Flaw.  You’d rather eat your armor than 
admit when you’re wrong.
Fighter Features
Fighting Style: Protection. When a 
creature you can see attacks a target 
other than you that is within 5 feet of 
you, you can use your reaction to impose 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You must 
be wielding a shield.
Second Wind. On your turn, you can 
use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + 3 hit 
points. Once you use this feature, you 
must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.
Action Surge. On your turn, you can 
take one additional action on top of your 
regular action and a possible bonus 
action.  Once you use this feature, you 
must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.Character Name

“You want to wield power like mine? You want to taste the fire? The price is high, but the flames 
are sweet.”
You made a pact with a fiendish 
entity years ago. They promised you unstoppable power born in the pits of the Nine Hells in exchange for your servitude 
and obeisance.
Background (Hermit)
Your path to power was not always so 
clear. You spent a great deal of time in seclusion, ruminating over whether or not 
it was worth it to continue, or to abandon 
your efforts and default on your debt.	 Discovery. 	The quiet seclusion of your 
extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on 
the campaign.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization that seeks to gather economic and political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	You connect 
everything that happens to you to a grand, cosmic plan.
 Ideal. Emotions must not cloud our 
sense of what is right and true, or our 
logical thinking. Bond. Should your discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.
 Flaw.  You would risk too much to 
uncover a lost bit of knowledge.

to cast warlock spells. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for your warlock 
spells. You use your Charisma whenever

of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish a 
short or long rest.Invocations

damage it deals on a hit. Note: This has 
already been applied in the stat block.

area of dim light or darkness, you can use 
your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or reaction.

Paladin 4
“No thanks are necessary. I am but a humble servant of the gods. Well, perhaps just one drink.”
You follow the path of righteousness, 
and everyone knows it. Your family 
built chapels to the gods of light and life throughout their lands, and you spread the good word as you travel.
 You move in the highest circles of the 
ruling classes and among the simple 
folk, bringing salvation wherever you go. You vigorously proclaim the virtues of an honorable life, though sometimes 
your audience doesn’t seem to share your 
enthusiasm. But you’re no stick-in-the-mud, and you enjoy the worldly rewards for a job well done.
Background (Noble)
You were born the eighth child of a minor noble family. You are accustomed to privilege and the comforts that come with 
it, but recognizing that you will never 
inherit, you set out as a youth to find your own path.   Position of Privilege. Thanks to your 
noble birth, people are inclined to think 
the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort 
to accommodate you and avoid your 
displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an 
audience with a local noble if you need to.
 Faction. You belong to the Lords’ 
Alliance, whose members ensure the safety and prosperity of civilized folk by standing united against the forces that 
threaten civilization.

that the common folk love you for your kindness and generosity. Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for those beneath you.

is unswerving. Flaw.  You have an insatiable desire for 
carnal pleasures.
Paladin Features

your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover.  Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit 
points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure 
multiple diseases and neutralize multiple 
poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.
 This feature has no effect on undead 
and constructs.
Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of the following options.
 Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can 
imbue one weapon that you are holding 
with positive energy. For 1 minute, you add a +3 bonus to attack rolls made with 
that weapon. The weapon also emits 
bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 10 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.
 You can end this effect on your turn 
as part of any other action. If you are no 
longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
 Turn the Unholy.  As an action, you 
present your holy symbol and speak a 
prayer censuring fiends and undead. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a DC

“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger. Spell Save DC: 13

Content: Savage Attacks. When you score a

Paladin Features
Aura of Protection. Whenever you or 
a friendly creature within 10 feet of you 
must make a saving throw, the creature 
gains a +3 bonus to the saving throw. You 
must be conscious to grant this bonus.
Divine Sense (4; Recharges after a 
Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any 
celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 
feet of you that is not behind total cover. 
You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. 
Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as 
with the hallow  spell.Half-Orc 
Paladin 8
“I might not be lovely to look 
upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”
Fury and resentment lie always just 
below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid, 
you were abandoned at a nearby temple 
and raised by the acolytes within. Despite 
the peaceful nature of their worship, your 
innate anger and resentment led you to 
the path of the war god.
 Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, an organization 
dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks 
and without hesitation.
 Personality Trait. You feel far more 
comfortable around animals than people.
 Ideal. You are driven to earn 
glory in battle.
 Bond.  You have sworn to bring terrible 
wrath down on evildoers.
 Flaw.  Violence is your answer to almost 
any challenge.
Half-Orc Traits
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Relentless Endurance (Recharges after 
a Long Rest). When you are reduced to 0 
hit points but not killed outright, you can 
drop to 1 hit point instead.Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of 
the following options.
 Abjure Enemy. As an action, you 
present your holy symbol and speak 
a prayer of denunciation. Choose one 
creature within 60 feet of you that you 
can see. That creature must make a 
DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, unless it 
is immune to being frightened. Fiends 
and undead have disadvantage on this 
saving throw. 
 On a failed save, the creature is 
frightened for 1 minute or until it takes 
any damage. While frightened, the 
creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit 
from any bonus to its speed.
 On a successful save, the creature’s 
speed is halved for 1 minute or until the 
creature takes any damage.
 Vow of Enmity.  As a bonus action, 
you can utter a vow of enmity against 
a creature you can see within 10 feet 
of you. You gain advantage on attack 
rolls against the creature for 1 minute 
or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls 
unconscious.Character Name

Content: High Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.
Wizard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the 
ability to cast spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
 You prepare the list of wizard spells 
that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose 6 spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
 You can use an arcane focus as a 
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
 You can cast any wizard spell in your 
spellbook as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.Elf Wizard 3
“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger. Spell Save DC: 13
 Spell Attack Modifier: +5
 Spell Slots: 1st-level (4), 2nd-level (2)
Arcane Recovery. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to 
or less than 2.
Arcane Tradition: School of 
Evocation
Evocation Savant. The gold and time you 
must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
Sculpt Spells. You can create pockets 
of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can 
choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no 
damage if they would take half damage 
on a successful save.

Content: You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow  spell.
 You can use this feature a 
number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.
Divine Smite. When you hit a creature 
with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one paladin spell slot to deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage to the target 
(3d8 radiant damage if it is an undead 
or a fiend).
Lay on Hands. You have a pool of healing 
power, with which you can restore up to 30 hit points. This pool replenishes after 
you finish a long rest.
 As an action, you can touch a creature 
and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, 
up to the maximum amount remaining 
in your pool.Human  
Paladin 6
“No thanks are necessary. I am but a humble servant of the gods. Well, perhaps just one drink.”
You follow the path of righteousness, 
and everyone knows it. Your family 
built chapels to the gods of light and life throughout their lands, and you spread the good word as you travel.
 You move in the highest circles of the 
ruling classes and among the simple 
folk, bringing salvation wherever you go. You vigorously proclaim the virtues of an honorable life, though sometimes 
your audience doesn’t seem to share your 
enthusiasm. But you’re no stick-in-the-mud, and you enjoy the worldly rewards for a job well done.
Background (Noble)
You were born the eighth child of a minor noble family. You are accustomed to privilege and the comforts that come with 
it, but recognizing that you will never 
inherit, you set out as a youth to find your own path.   Position of Privilege. Thanks to your 
noble birth, people are inclined to think 
the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort 
to accommodate you and avoid your 
displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an 
audience with a local noble if you need to.
 Faction. You belong to the Lords’ 
Alliance, whose members ensure the safety and prosperity of civilized folk by standing united against the forces that 
threaten civilization.
 Personality Trait. You are convinced 
that the common folk love you for your kindness and generosity. Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for those beneath you.
 Bond. Your loyalty to your sovereign 
is unswerving. Flaw.  You have an insatiable desire for 
carnal pleasures.
Paladin Features
Divine Sense (4; Recharges after a Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover.  Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit 
points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize 
one poison affecting it. You can cure 
multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.
 This feature has no effect on undead 
and constructs.
Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of the following options.
 Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can 
imbue one weapon that you are holding 
with positive energy. For 1 minute, you add a +3 bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon. The weapon also emits 
bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim 
light 10 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn 
as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.

“You want to wield power like mine? You want to taste the fire? The price is high, but the flames 
are sweet.”
You made a pact with a fiendish 
entity years ago. They promised you unstoppable power born in the pits of the Nine Hells in exchange for your servitude 
and obeisance.
Background (Hermit)

clear. You spent a great deal of time in seclusion, ruminating over whether or not 
it was worth it to continue, or to abandon

extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on

one of your druid spells, you must expend 
a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You 
regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the druid spell list. When you do so, 
choose up to thirteen druid spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. When you prepare new spells, you must meditate 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
 Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your druid spells, Human Druid 9
“All things have a spirit 
within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips. You know three cantrips, 
which you can cast at will.since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
 Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual 
tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as 
a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
Wild Shape (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can take a bonus action to magically assume 
the shape of a beast that you have seen 
before, provided that the beast has a challenge rating of 3 or lower. You can use this feature twice.

While you wear this pendant, you

 Wild Shape (cont’d). You can stay in 
a beast shape for 4 hours, and then you 
revert to your normal form unless you 
expend another use of this feature. You 
can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 
hit points, or die.
 While you are transformed, the 
following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by 
the statistics of the beast, but you 
retain your alignment, personality, and 
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addi -
tion to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is 
higher than yours, use the creature’s 
bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
• When you transform, you assume the 
beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When 
you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, 
if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 
hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires 
hands is limited to the capabilities of 
your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent 
you from taking actions that are part of 
a spell that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form 
is physically capable of doing so. 
However, your senses are replaced by those of the beast.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn 
by it. Worn equipment functions as 
normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the crea -
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. 
Equipment that merges with the form 
has no effect until you leave the form.

Content: Human 
Fighter 1
“Measure twice, cut once. Or two 
or three times, whatever works. Maybe 
five.”
You crave adventure like most people 
crave food or drink. You lived in any 
number of cities and villages during your 
time with the military, but no one place 
has ever truly felt like home–and you 
have slowly come to the conclusion that 
this is according to your preferences. 
Background (Soldier)
You were a professional soldier. You 
traveled to foreign lands, led troops into 
danger, fought wars under the banners 
of different commanders. Yet, you craved 
something more out of life, and resigned 
your commission. Now you are out on 
your own, living by your wits, taking 
orders from no one.
 Military Rank. You were a low-ranked 
officer in a military organization. Soldiers 
loyal to your former military organization 
still recognize your authority and 
influence, and they defer to you if they are 
of a lower rank.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and 
vigilant group that seeks to protect others 
from the depredations of evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can stare down 
a hell hound without flinching.
 Ideal. When people follow orders 
blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
 Bond.  You fight for those who cannot 
fight for themselves.
 Flaw.  You’d rather eat your armor than 
admit when you’re wrong.
Fighter Features
Fighting Style: Protection. When a 
creature you can see attacks a target 
other than you that is within 5 feet of 
you, you can use your reaction to impose 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You must 
be wielding a shield.
Second Wind. On your turn, you can 
use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + 1 hit 
points. Once you use this feature, you 
must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.

Channel Divinity (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can channel divine energy to create one of the 
following effects. You can do so once.
 Preserve Life. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore up to 15 hit 
points. Choose any creatures within 30

a creature to no more than half of its 
hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct. Turn Undead. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and speak a prayer 
censuring the undead. Each undead that

“By Moradin’s hammer, be made whole!”
Although you started out as 
an artisan, you heard the 
voice of the dwarven deities 
in the stones you carved and metal you shaped. Your acts of artistry became acts of reverence, causing you 
to desire to exemplify the inner nature of 
your people. You joined the clergy, and your pure dwarven desires allowed you to connect to the divine.
Background  (Guild Jeweler)
Before you became devoted to the dwarven deities, you were a journeyman jeweler and gem cutter. Even outside your 
home, you are recognized by your badge 
and skill. You have the aid of a loose coalition of guilds, and one day you shall 
become a master your own right. Seeking 
such mastery is an act of worship to you. Guild Member. Fellow guild members 
can provide you with necessities, and 
the guild can use its political power to 
aid you. In some areas, a guildhall offers a place to meet other members of your profession and those who aid the guild. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month 
to the guild. If you miss payments, you 
must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lords’ Alliance, a loose coalition of established political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. A perfectionist, you 
demand a lot from yourself and expect 
the most from others. 
 Ideal. It is the duty of civilized people to 
strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization.
 Bond. You aim to prove you are the 
greatest artisan of them all. Flaw.  You are greedy. So you can’t part 
with money easily, and you haggle to get the best possible deal.
Dwarf Features
Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Stonecunning. You have a +4 bonus on 
Intelligence (History) checks related to 
the origin of stonework.can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take 
reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If 
there’s nowhere to move, the creature can 
use the Dodge action.
Life Domain. The Life domain focuses 
on the vibrant positive energy—one of 
the fundamental forces of the universe—
that sustains all life. You gain a number of domain spells, which are always considered to be prepared, as a result of 
this domain. In addition, you have access 
to the following features: Disciple of Life. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit 
points to a creature, the creature regains 
additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

“All things have a spirit within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability.
 Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
Wild Shape (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can 
take a bonus action to magically assume 
the shape of a beast that you have seen before, provided that the beast has a challenge rating of 2 or lower. You can use this feature twice.

 Wild Shape (cont’d). You can stay in 
a beast shape for 4 hours, and then you 
revert to your normal form unless you 
expend another use of this feature. You 
can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 
hit points, or die.
 While you are transformed, the 
following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by 
the statistics of the beast, but you 
retain your alignment, personality, and 
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addi -
tion to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is 
higher than yours, use the creature’s 
bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
• When you transform, you assume the 
beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When 
you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, 
if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 
hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires 
hands is limited to the capabilities of 
your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent 
you from taking actions that are part of 
a spell that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form 
is physically capable of doing so. 
However, your senses are replaced by those of the beast.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn 
by it. Worn equipment functions as 
normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the crea -
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. 
Equipment that merges with the form 
has no effect until you leave the form.

saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.

“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger. Spell Save DC: 13
 Spell Attack Modifier: +5
 Spell Slots: 1st-level (3)
Arcane Recovery. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to 
or less than 1.
Arcane Tradition: School of 
Evocation
Evocation Savant. The gold and time you 
must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
Sculpt Spells. You can create pockets 
of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can 
choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no 
damage if they would take half damage 
on a successful save.

“Hail pounding cobbled roofs 
into rubble, waves pulverizing rocks 
into pebbles, the crack of trees split by 
lightning, the crash of thunder, making 
the strongest men flinch... was there ever 
a more beautiful symphony?”
You are a worshiper of destructive 
weather: an initiate devoted to the 
wrath of thunder and the divine justice 
of lightning. You may not be the most 
popular priest in your community, but few 
are foolish enough to risk your ire.
Background (Pirate)
Your youth was spent on the high seas, 
as a crewmember on a ship of cutthroats. 
Your devotion to the gods of wrath 
began as simple rituals to ward off harsh 
weather. As you spent more years at sea, 
your bond with the forces of destruction 
grew ever stronger.
 Bad Reputation. No matter where you 
go, people are afraid of you due to your 
reputation. When you are in a civilized 
settlement, you can get away with minor 
criminal offenses.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization 
that seeks to gather economic and 
political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	 You like a job well 
done, especially if you can convince 
someone else to do it.
 Ideal. The sea is freedom–the freedom 
to go anywhere and do anything.
 Bond.  The ship is most important–
crewmates and captains come and go.
 Flaw.  Once someone questions your 
courage, you never back down no matter 
how dangerous the situation.

Content: Savage Attacks. When you score a 
critical hit with a melee weapon attack, 
you can roll one of the weapon’s damage 
dice one additional time and add it to the 
extra damage of the critical hit.
Paladin Features
Aura of Protection. Whenever you or 
a friendly creature within 10 feet of you 
must make a saving throw, the creature 
gains a +3 bonus to the saving throw. You 
must be conscious to grant this bonus.
Divine Sense (4; Recharges after a 
Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any 
celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 
feet of you that is not behind total cover. 
You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. 
Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as 
with the hallow  spell.Half-Orc 
Paladin 9
“I might not be lovely to look 
upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”
Fury and resentment lie always just 
below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid, 
you were abandoned at a nearby temple 
and raised by the acolytes within. Despite 
the peaceful nature of their worship, your 
innate anger and resentment led you to 
the path of the war god.
 Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, an organization 
dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks 
and without hesitation.
 Personality Trait. You feel far more 
comfortable around animals than people.
 Ideal. You are driven to earn 
glory in battle.
 Bond.  You have sworn to bring terrible 
wrath down on evildoers.
 Flaw.  Violence is your answer to almost 
any challenge.
Half-Orc Traits
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Relentless Endurance (Recharges after 
a Long Rest). When you are reduced to 0 
hit points but not killed outright, you can 
drop to 1 hit point instead.Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of 
the following options.
 Abjure Enemy. As an action, you 
present your holy symbol and speak

upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”

below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid,

“Size of the body indicates 
nothing of the depth of the spirit.”
Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the 
cruel and wicked, especially those who 
harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.

including counseling and aiding others.
 Shelter of the Faithful. You and your 
companions can receive aid at any site

“Measure twice, cut once. Or two 
or three times, whatever works. Maybe 
five.”
You crave adventure like most people 
crave food or drink. You lived in any 
number of cities and villages during your 
time with the military, but no one place 
has ever truly felt like home–and you 
have slowly come to the conclusion that 
this is according to your preferences. 
Background (Soldier)
You were a professional soldier. You 
traveled to foreign lands, led troops into 
danger, fought wars under the banners 
of different commanders. Yet, you craved 
something more out of life, and resigned 
your commission. Now you are out on 
your own, living by your wits, taking 
orders from no one.
 Military Rank. You were a low-ranked 
officer in a military organization. Soldiers 
loyal to your former military organization 
still recognize your authority and 
influence, and they defer to you if they are 
of a lower rank.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and 
vigilant group that seeks to protect others 
from the depredations of evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can stare down 
a hell hound without flinching.
 Ideal. When people follow orders 
blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
 Bond.  You fight for those who cannot 
fight for themselves.
 Flaw.  You’d rather eat your armor than 
admit when you’re wrong.
Fighter Features
Fighting Style: Protection. When a 
creature you can see attacks a target 
other than you that is within 5 feet of 
you, you can use your reaction to impose 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You must 
be wielding a shield.
Second Wind. On your turn, you can 
use a bonus action to regain 1d10 + 10

must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.

take one additional action on top of your 
regular action and a possible bonus

must finish a short or long rest before you 
can use it again.Equipment

Bardic Inspiration. You may use a 
bonus action on your turn to choose 
one creature other than yourself 
within 60 feet of you who can hear 
you. That creature gains one Bardic 
Inspiration die, a d6.
 Once within the next 10 minutes, 
the creature can roll the die and add 
the number rolled to one ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The 
creature can wait until after it rolls the 
d20 before deciding to use the Bardic 
Inspiration die, but must decide before 
the DM says whether the roll succeeds or 
fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is 
rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only 
one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
 You can use this feature 3 times. You 
regain any expended uses when you 
finish a long rest.Half-elf  
Bard 2
“It seems I struck a chord. Ha! I 
love that one.”
The life of a vagabond is the 
only life you’ve ever known, and 
your various talents have rarely failed to 
provide you a warm bed and a hot supper. 
But mere survival is not enough anymore. 
You have discovered the hidden magic of 
words and music, and it is time for you 
to weave yourself into the stories told 
in hushed tones over steaming drinks, 
inspiring wonder in their listeners.
Background (Entertainer)
You have been the center of attention 
since before you could walk, and once 
you learned to sing and play, you never 
surrendered the spotlight again. And who 
deserves it more than you?
 By Popular Demand. You can always 
find a place to perform. You receive 
free lodging and food of a modest or 
comfortable standard as long as you 
perform each night. When strangers 
recognize you in a town where you 
have performed, they typically take a 
liking to you.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine organization who 
work against tyranny through the sharing 
of information and lore.
 Personality Trait. You change your 
mood or your mind as quickly as you 
change key in a song.
 Ideal. When you perform, you make the 
world better than it was.
 Bond.  You will do anything to prove 
yourself superior to your hated rival.
 Flaw.  You’re a sucker for a pretty face.
Half-elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright 
light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Bard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the 
ability to cast spells. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for your bard spells. 
You use your Charisma whenever a spell 
refers to your spellcasting ability.Jack of All Trades. You can add half 
your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to 
any ability check you make that doesn’t 
already include your proficiency bonus.
Song of Rest. You can use soothing 
music or oration to help revitalize 
your wounded allies. If you or any 
friendly creatures who can hear your 
performance regain hit points at the end 
of a short rest, each of those creatures 
regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

Content:  Preparing and Casting Spells. To cast 
one of your druid spells, you must expend 
a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You 
regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the druid spell list. When you do 
so, choose up to eight druid spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. When you prepare new spells, you must meditate 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
 Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your druid spells, 
since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability.Human Druid 5
“All things have a spirit 
within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips. You know three cantrips, 
which you can cast at will. Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
Wild Shape (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can 
take a bonus action to magically assume 
the shape of a beast that you have seen before, provided that the beast has a challenge rating of 1, or lower, and has no flying speed. You can use this 
feature twice.
 You can stay in a beast shape for 2 
hours, and then you revert to your normal form unless you expend another use 
of this feature. You can revert to your 
normal form earlier by using a bonus action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

 Wild Shape (cont’d). While you are 
transformed, the following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by 
the statistics of the beast, but you 
retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill 
and saving throw proficiencies, in addi -
tion to gaining those of the creature. If 
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s 
bonus instead of yours. If the creature 
has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
• When you transform, you assume the 
beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When 
you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you 
had before you transformed. However, 
if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to 
speak or take any action that requires 
hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell 
you’ve already cast, however, or prevent 
you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source 
and can use them if the new form 
is physically capable of doing so. However, your senses are replaced by those of the beast.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it 
is practical for the new form to wear a 
piece of equipment, based on the crea -
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either 
fall to the ground or merge with it. 
Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
 Combat Wild Shape. While you are 
transformed, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

Barbarian 2
“The wild is in my blood.”
Hailing from the northern 
lands, you are a stranger to 
civilization. Yet you travel 
wherever need guides you,  
fighting those who would despoil the 
wilderness. You have faced encroaching 
evil from monsters to greedy humans. 
You take what you need, and feed the 
ground with the blood of such enemies.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up among tribal nomads, 
far from civilization and its comforts. 
You’ve hunted great herds, survived 
extreme weather, raided the trade of 
softer folk, and protected places sacred 
to your people. At times, you’ve enjoyed 
the solitude of being the only sentient 
creature for miles in any direction. Even 
in places where the terrain is new, you 
know the ways of the wild.
 Wanderer. As a former barbarian 
nomad and raider, you have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers enough.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats.
 Personality Trait. You place no stock 
in refined manners or wealth.
 Ideal. Life is constant change, and you 
must change with it to survive.
 Bond.  You take the despoiling of 
the wilderness and sacred sites as a 
personal insult.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.
Barbarian Features
Danger Sense.  You have advantage on 
Dexterity saving throws against effects 
that you can see. To gain this benefit, 
you can’t be blinded, deafened, or

presence you sense, but not its identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow  spell.
 You can use this feature a 
number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.
Divine Smite. When you hit a creature 
with a melee weapon attack, you can 
expend one paladin spell slot to deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage to the target (3d8 radiant damage if it is an undead or a fiend).
Lay on Hands. You have a pool of healing 
power, with which you can restore up to Human  
Paladin 10
“No thanks are necessary. I am but a humble servant of the gods. Well, perhaps just one drink.”
You follow the path of righteousness, 
and everyone knows it. Your family 
built chapels to the gods of light and life throughout their lands, and you spread the good word as you travel.
 You move in the highest circles of the 
ruling classes and among the simple 
folk, bringing salvation wherever you go. You vigorously proclaim the virtues of an honorable life, though sometimes 
your audience doesn’t seem to share your 
enthusiasm. But you’re no stick-in-the-mud, and you enjoy the worldly rewards for a job well done.
Background (Noble)
You were born the eighth child of a minor noble family. You are accustomed to privilege and the comforts that come with 
it, but recognizing that you will never 
inherit, you set out as a youth to find your own path.   Position of Privilege. Thanks to your 
noble birth, people are inclined to think 
the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort 
to accommodate you and avoid your 
displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an 
audience with a local noble if you need to.
 Faction. You belong to the Lords’ 
Alliance, whose members ensure the safety and prosperity of civilized folk by standing united against the forces that 
threaten civilization.
 Personality Trait. You are convinced 
that the common folk love you for your kindness and generosity. Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for those beneath you.
 Bond. Your loyalty to your sovereign 
is unswerving. Flaw.  You have an insatiable desire for 
carnal pleasures.
Paladin Features
Aura of Courage. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.
Aura of Devotion. You and friendly 
creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.50 hit points. This pool replenishes after you finish a long rest. As an action, you can touch a creature 
and draw power from the pool to restore 
a number of hit points to that creature, 
up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit 
points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on 
Hands, expending hit points separately 
for each one. This feature has no effect on undead 
and constructs.
Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of 
the following options.
 Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can 
imbue one weapon that you are holding 
with positive energy. For 1 minute, you 
add a +4 bonus to attack rolls made with 
that weapon. The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 10 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical 
for the duration.

Barbarian 3
“The wild is in my blood.”
Hailing from the northern 
lands, you are a stranger to 
civilization. Yet you travel 
wherever need guides you,  
fighting those who would despoil the 
wilderness. You have faced encroaching 
evil from monsters to greedy humans. 
You take what you need, and feed the 
ground with the blood of such enemies.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up among tribal nomads, 
far from civilization and its comforts. 
You’ve hunted great herds, survived 
extreme weather, raided the trade of 
softer folk, and protected places sacred 
to your people. At times, you’ve enjoyed 
the solitude of being the only sentient 
creature for miles in any direction. Even 
in places where the terrain is new, you 
know the ways of the wild.
 Wanderer. As a former barbarian 
nomad and raider, you have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers enough.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats.
 Personality Trait. You place no stock 
in refined manners or wealth.
 Ideal. Life is constant change, and you 
must change with it to survive.

--- Chunk 174 ---
Content:  Preparing and Casting Spells. To cast 
one of your druid spells, you must expend 
a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You 
regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest. You prepare the list of druid spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the druid spell list. When you do 
so, choose up to seven druid spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. When you prepare new spells, you must meditate 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
 Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your druid spells, 
since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability.Human Druid 4
“All things have a spirit 
within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips. You know three cantrips, 
which you can cast at will. Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
Wild Shape (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can 
take a bonus action to magically assume 
the shape of a beast that you have seen before, provided that the beast has a challenge rating of 1, or lower, and has no flying speed. You can use this 
feature twice.
 You can stay in a beast shape for 2 
hours, and then you revert to your normal form unless you expend another use 
of this feature. You can revert to your 
normal form earlier by using a bonus action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

 Wild Shape (cont’d). While you are 
transformed, the following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by 
the statistics of the beast, but you 
retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill 
and saving throw proficiencies, in addi -
tion to gaining those of the creature. If 
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s 
bonus instead of yours. If the creature 
has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
• When you transform, you assume the 
beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When 
you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you 
had before you transformed. However, 
if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to 
speak or take any action that requires 
hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell 
you’ve already cast, however, or prevent 
you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source 
and can use them if the new form 
is physically capable of doing so. However, your senses are replaced by those of the beast.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it 
is practical for the new form to wear a 
piece of equipment, based on the crea -
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either 
fall to the ground or merge with it. 
Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
 Combat Wild Shape. While you are 
transformed, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

the creature can roll the die and add 
the number rolled to one ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The 
creature can wait until after it rolls the 
d20 before deciding to use the Bardic 
Inspiration die, but must decide before 
the DM says whether the roll succeeds or 
fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is 
rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only 
one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.Half-elf  
Bard 3
“It seems I struck a chord. Ha! I 
love that one.”
The life of a vagabond is the 
only life you’ve ever known, and 
your various talents have rarely failed to 
provide you a warm bed and a hot supper. 
But mere survival is not enough anymore. 
You have discovered the hidden magic of 
words and music, and it is time for you 
to weave yourself into the stories told 
in hushed tones over steaming drinks, 
inspiring wonder in their listeners.
Background (Entertainer)
You have been the center of attention 
since before you could walk, and once 
you learned to sing and play, you never 
surrendered the spotlight again. And who 
deserves it more than you?
 By Popular Demand. You can always 
find a place to perform. You receive 
free lodging and food of a modest or 
comfortable standard as long as you 
perform each night. When strangers 
recognize you in a town where you 
have performed, they typically take a 
liking to you.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine organization who 
work against tyranny through the sharing 
of information and lore.
 Personality Trait. You change your 
mood or your mind as quickly as you 
change key in a song.
 Ideal. When you perform, you make the 
world better than it was.
 Bond.  You will do anything to prove 
yourself superior to your hated rival.
 Flaw.  You’re a sucker for a pretty face.
Half-elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright 
light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Bard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the 
ability to cast spells. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for your bard spells. 
You use your Charisma whenever a spell 
refers to your spellcasting ability. You can use this feature 3 times. You 
regain any expended uses when you 
finish a long rest.
Jack of All Trades. You can add half 
your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to 
any ability check you make that doesn’t 
already include your proficiency bonus.
Song of Rest. You can use soothing 
music or oration to help revitalize 
your wounded allies. If you or any 
friendly creatures who can hear your 
performance regain hit points at the end 
of a short rest, each of those creatures 
regains an extra 1d6 hit points.
Bard College: College of 
Lore
Cutting Words. When a creature that you 
can see within 60 feet of you makes an 
attack roll, an ability check, or a damage 
roll, you can use your reaction to expend 
one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, 
rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and 
subtracting the number rolled from the 
creature’s roll. You can choose to use this 
feature after the creature makes its roll, 
but before the DM determines whether 
the attack roll or ability check succeeds 
or fails, or before the creature deals Character Name

Content: 	 Deflect	Missiles.	 When you are hit by a 
ranged weapon attack, you can use your 
reaction to reduce the damage you take 
from the attack by 1d10 + 6.
 If you reduce the damage to 0, you can 
catch the missile if it is small enough for 
you to hold in one hand and you have at 
least one hand free. If you catch a missile 
in this way, you can spend 1 ki point 
to make a ranged attack with what you 
caught, as part of the same reaction. You 
make this attack with proficiency, and 
the missile counts as a monk weapon 
for the attack.
	 Flurry	of	Blows.	 Immediately after 
you take the Attack action on your turn, 
you can spend 1 ki point to make two 
unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
 Whenever you hit a creature with one of 
these attacks, you can impose one of the 
following three effects on that target:
• It must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity 
saving throw or be knocked prone.
• It must succeed on a DC 13 Strength 
saving throw, or you can push it up to 
15 feet away from you.Halfling 
Monk 3
“Size	of	the	body	indicates	
nothing	of	the	depth	of	the	spirit.”
Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the 
cruel and wicked, especially those who 
harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.
Background (Acolyte)
You spent your formative years in a 
monastery dedicated to the Triad—Torm, 
Tyr, and primarily for your order, Ilmater, 
god of endurance and martyrdom. As 
a priest, you can perform sacred rites, 
including counseling and aiding others.
 Shelter of the Faithful. You and your 
companions can receive aid at any site 
dedicated to the Triad or its member 
deities, especially Ilmater. You must 
provide any material components for 
spells cast on your behalf. Those who 
share your religion support you at a 
modest lifestyle.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, seekers of justice 
who protect others from evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can find 
common ground between the fiercest 
enemies, empathizing with them and 
always working toward peace.
 Ideal. You always try to help those in 
need, no matter what the personal cost.
 Bond.  Everything you do is to protect 
the common folk.
 Flaw.  You place too much trust in those 
who profess to share your faith.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness.  You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, you 
can reroll the die and use the new roll.
Monk Features

or Long Rest). You have 3 ki points,

under this feature). You must spend at 
least 30 minutes of a rest meditating to

Paladin Features
Divine Sense (4; Recharges after a 
Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any 
celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 
feet of you that is not behind total cover. 
You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. 
Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as 
with the hallow  spell.
Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of 
the following options.

Paladin 5
“I might not be lovely to look 
upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”
Fury and resentment lie always just 
below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid, 
you were abandoned at a nearby temple 
and raised by the acolytes within. Despite 
the peaceful nature of their worship, your 
innate anger and resentment led you to 
the path of the war god.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, an organization 
dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks 
and without hesitation.
 Personality Trait. You feel far more 
comfortable around animals than people.
 Ideal. You are driven to earn 
glory in battle.
 Bond.  You have sworn to bring terrible 
wrath down on evildoers.
 Flaw.  Violence is your answer to almost 
any challenge.
Half-Orc Traits
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Relentless Endurance (Recharges after 
a Long Rest). When you are reduced to 0 
hit points but not killed outright, you can 
drop to 1 hit point instead.creature within 60 feet of you that you 
can see. That creature must make a 
DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, unless it 
is immune to being frightened. Fiends 
and undead have disadvantage on this 
saving throw. 
 On a failed save, the creature is 
frightened for 1 minute or until it takes 
any damage. While frightened, the 
creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit 
from any bonus to its speed.
 On a successful save, the creature’s 
speed is halved for 1 minute or until the 
creature takes any damage.
 Vow of Enmity.  As a bonus action, 
you can utter a vow of enmity against 
a creature you can see within 10 feet 
of you. You gain advantage on attack 
rolls against the creature for 1 minute 
or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls 
unconscious.
Divine Smite. When you hit a creature 
with a melee weapon attack, you can 
expend one paladin spell slot to deal an

“You want to wield power like 
mine? You want to taste the fire? The price is high, but the flames 
are sweet.”
You made a pact with a fiendish 
entity years ago. They promised you unstoppable power born in the pits of the Nine Hells in exchange for your servitude 
and obeisance.
Background (Hermit)
Your path to power was not always so 
clear. You spent a great deal of time in seclusion, ruminating over whether or not 
it was worth it to continue, or to abandon 
your efforts and default on your debt.	 Discovery. 	The quiet seclusion of your 
extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on 
the campaign.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization that seeks to gather economic and political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	You connect 
everything that happens to you to a grand, cosmic plan.
 Ideal. Emotions must not cloud our 
sense of what is right and true, or our 
logical thinking. Bond. Should your discovery come to light, it could bring ruin to the world.
	 Flaw.  You would risk too much to 
uncover a lost bit of knowledge.
Tiefling Features
Darkvision. 	You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright 
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Warlock Features

to cast warlock spells. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for your warlock 
spells. You use your Charisma whenever 
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish a 
short or long rest.seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur. Once you use this feature, you can’t 
use it again until you finish a short or long rest.Fiendish Resilience. You can choose one damage type when you finish a 
short or long rest. You gain resistance 
to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

Content: Savage Attacks. When you score a 
critical hit with a melee weapon attack, 
you can roll one of the weapon’s damage 
dice one additional time and add it to the 
extra damage of the critical hit.
Paladin Features
Aura of Protection. Whenever you or 
a friendly creature within 10 feet of you 
must make a saving throw, the creature 
gains a +3 bonus to the saving throw. You 
must be conscious to grant this bonus.
Divine Sense (4; Recharges after a 
Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any 
celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 
feet of you that is not behind total cover. 
You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. 
Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as 
with the hallow  spell.Half-Orc 
Paladin 7
“I might not be lovely to look 
upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”
Fury and resentment lie always just 
below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid, 
you were abandoned at a nearby temple 
and raised by the acolytes within. Despite 
the peaceful nature of their worship, your 
innate anger and resentment led you to 
the path of the war god.
 Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, an organization 
dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks 
and without hesitation.
 Personality Trait. You feel far more 
comfortable around animals than people.
 Ideal. You are driven to earn 
glory in battle.
 Bond.  You have sworn to bring terrible 
wrath down on evildoers.
 Flaw.  Violence is your answer to almost 
any challenge.
Half-Orc Traits
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Relentless Endurance (Recharges after 
a Long Rest). When you are reduced to 0 
hit points but not killed outright, you can 
drop to 1 hit point instead.Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of 
the following options.
 Abjure Enemy. As an action, you 
present your holy symbol and speak 
a prayer of denunciation. Choose one 
creature within 60 feet of you that you 
can see. That creature must make a 
DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, unless it 
is immune to being frightened. Fiends 
and undead have disadvantage on this 
saving throw. 
 On a failed save, the creature is 
frightened for 1 minute or until it takes 
any damage. While frightened, the 
creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit 
from any bonus to its speed.
 On a successful save, the creature’s 
speed is halved for 1 minute or until the 
creature takes any damage.
 Vow of Enmity.  As a bonus action, 
you can utter a vow of enmity against 
a creature you can see within 10 feet 
of you. You gain advantage on attack 
rolls against the creature for 1 minute 
or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls 
unconscious.Character Name

Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.
Wizard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the 
ability to cast spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. 
You use your Intelligence whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You prepare the list of wizard spells 
that are available for you to cast. To do so, 
choose 15 spells. The spells must be of a 
level for which you have spell slots. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish

“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger. Spell Save DC: 17
 Spell Attack Modifier: +9
 Spell Slots: 1st-level (4), 2nd-level (3),

you finish a short rest, you can choose 
expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than 5.
Arcane Tradition: School of 
Evocation
Evocation Savant. The gold and time you 
must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
Sculpt Spells. You can create pockets 
of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast 
an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures 
automatically succeed on their saving 
throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would take half damage on a successful save.Potent Cantrip. Your damaging cantrips 
affect even creatures that avoid the brunt 
of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s 
damage (if any) but suffers no additional 
effect from the cantrip.Empowered Evocation. You can add your Intelligence modifier to the

Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the

harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.

monastery dedicated to the Triad—Torm, 
Tyr, and primarily for your order, Ilmater, 
god of endurance and martyrdom. As 
a priest, you can perform sacred rites, 
including counseling and aiding others.
 Shelter of the Faithful. You and your 
companions can receive aid at any site 
dedicated to the Triad or its member 
deities, especially Ilmater. You must 
provide any material components for

who protect others from evildoers.

need, no matter what the personal cost.

“Hail pounding cobbled roofs 
into rubble, waves pulverizing rocks 
into pebbles, the crack of trees split by 
lightning, the crash of thunder, making 
the strongest men flinch... was there ever 
a more beautiful symphony?”
You are a worshiper of destructive 
weather: an initiate devoted to the 
wrath of thunder and the divine justice 
of lightning. You may not be the most 
popular priest in your community, but few 
are foolish enough to risk your ire.
Background (Pirate)
Your youth was spent on the high seas, 
as a crewmember on a ship of cutthroats.

weather. As you spent more years at sea, 
your bond with the forces of destruction

reputation. When you are in a civilized

Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization 
that seeks to gather economic and 
political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.

how dangerous the situation.

“You want to wield power like mine? You want to taste the fire? The price is high, but the flames 
are sweet.”
You made a pact with a fiendish 
entity years ago. They promised you unstoppable power born in the pits of the Nine Hells in exchange for your servitude 
and obeisance.

Your path to power was not always so 
clear. You spent a great deal of time in seclusion, ruminating over whether or not 
it was worth it to continue, or to abandon 
your efforts and default on your debt.	 Discovery. 	The quiet seclusion of your 
extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on 
the campaign.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization that seeks to gather economic and political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	You connect 
everything that happens to you to a grand, cosmic plan.
 Ideal. Emotions must not cloud our

uncover a lost bit of knowledge.

Content:  Cantrips. You know three cantrips, 
which you can cast at will.
 Preparing and Casting Spells. To cast 
one of your druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
 You prepare the list of druid spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose up to nine druid spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have 
spell slots.
 You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. When you prepare new spells, you must 
meditate 1 minute per spell level for each 
spell on your list.Human Druid 6
“All things have a spirit within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You 
use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability. Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual 
tag and you have the spell prepared.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
Wild Shape (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can 
take a bonus action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before, provided that the beast has a 
challenge rating of 2, or lower, and 
has no flying speed. You can use this feature twice.

 Wild Shape (cont’d). You can stay in 
a beast shape for 3 hours, and then you revert to your normal form unless you 
expend another use of this feature. You 
can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 
hit points, or die.
 While you are transformed, the 
following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by 
the statistics of the beast, but you 
retain your alignment, personality, and 
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addi -
tion to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is 
higher than yours, use the creature’s 
bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
• When you transform, you assume the 
beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When 
you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, 
if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 
hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires 
hands is limited to the capabilities of 
your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent 
you from taking actions that are part of 
a spell that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form 
is physically capable of doing so. 
However, your senses are replaced by those of the beast.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn 
by it. Worn equipment functions as 
normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the crea -
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. 
Equipment that merges with the form 
has no effect until you leave the form.

Barbarian 1
“The wild is in my blood.”
Hailing from the northern 
lands, you are a stranger to 
civilization. Yet you travel 
wherever need guides you,  
fighting those who would despoil the 
wilderness. You have faced encroaching 
evil from monsters to greedy humans. 
You take what you need, and feed the 
ground with the blood of such enemies.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up among tribal nomads, 
far from civilization and its comforts. 
You’ve hunted great herds, survived 
extreme weather, raided the trade of 
softer folk, and protected places sacred 
to your people. At times, you’ve enjoyed 
the solitude of being the only sentient 
creature for miles in any direction. Even 
in places where the terrain is new, you 
know the ways of the wild.
 Wanderer. As a former barbarian 
nomad and raider, you have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers enough.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats.
 Personality Trait. You place no stock 
in refined manners or wealth.
 Ideal. Life is constant change, and you 
must change with it to survive.
 Bond.  You take the despoiling of 
the wilderness and sacred sites as a 
personal insult.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.

“All things have a spirit 
within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Cantrips. You know three cantrips, 
which you can cast at will.devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual 
tag and you have the spell prepared.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
Wild Shape (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can 
take a bonus action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before, provided that the beast has a 
challenge rating of 2, or lower, and 
has no flying speed. You can use this feature twice.

whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit

 Wild Shape (cont’d). You can stay in 
a beast shape for 3 hours, and then you revert to your normal form unless you 
expend another use of this feature. You 
can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 
hit points, or die.
 While you are transformed, the 
following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by 
the statistics of the beast, but you 
retain your alignment, personality, and 
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addi -
tion to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is 
higher than yours, use the creature’s 
bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
• When you transform, you assume the 
beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When 
you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, 
if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 
hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires 
hands is limited to the capabilities of 
your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent 
you from taking actions that are part of 
a spell that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form 
is physically capable of doing so. 
However, your senses are replaced by those of the beast.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn 
by it. Worn equipment functions as 
normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the crea -
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. 
Equipment that merges with the form 
has no effect until you leave the form.

Cleric 8
“Hail pounding cobbled roofs 
into rubble, waves pulverizing rocks 
into pebbles, the crack of trees split by 
lightning, the crash of thunder, making 
the strongest men flinch... was there ever 
a more beautiful symphony?”
You are a worshiper of destructive 
weather: an initiate devoted to the 
wrath of thunder and the divine justice 
of lightning. You may not be the most 
popular priest in your community, but few 
are foolish enough to risk your ire.
Background (Pirate)
Your youth was spent on the high seas, 
as a crewmember on a ship of cutthroats. 
Your devotion to the gods of wrath 
began as simple rituals to ward off harsh 
weather. As you spent more years at sea, 
your bond with the forces of destruction 
grew ever stronger.
 Bad Reputation. No matter where you 
go, people are afraid of you due to your 
reputation. When you are in a civilized 
settlement, you can get away with minor 
criminal offenses.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an unscrupulous organization 
that seeks to gather economic and 
political control through both legitimate 
and shady means.
 Personality	Trait.	 You like a job well 
done, especially if you can convince 
someone else to do it.
 Ideal. The sea is freedom–the freedom 
to go anywhere and do anything.
 Bond.  The ship is most important–
crewmates and captains come and go.
 Flaw.  Once someone questions your 
courage, you never back down no matter 
how dangerous the situation.
Cleric Features

to cast divine spells. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. 
You use your Wisdom whenever a spell 
refers to your spellcasting ability.
 You prepare the list of cleric spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the cleric spell list. When you do so, 
choose 13 spells. The spells must be of a 
level for which you have spell slots.
 To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute 
or until it takes any damage.
 A turned creature must spend its turns 
trying to move as far away from you as it 
can, and it can’t willingly move to a space 
within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take 
reactions. For its action, it can use only 
the Dash action or try to escape from 
an effect that prevents it from moving. If 
there’s nowhere to move, the creature can 
use the Dodge action.

fails its saving throw against your Turn

Paladin Features
Aura of Protection. Whenever you or 
a friendly creature within 10 feet of you 
must make a saving throw, the creature 
gains a +3 bonus to the saving throw. You 
must be conscious to grant this bonus.
Divine Sense (4; Recharges after a 
Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any 
celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 
feet of you that is not behind total cover. 
You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. 
Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as 
with the hallow  spell.Half-Orc 
Paladin 6
“I might not be lovely to look 
upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”
Fury and resentment lie always just 
below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid, 
you were abandoned at a nearby temple 
and raised by the acolytes within. Despite 
the peaceful nature of their worship, your 
innate anger and resentment led you to 
the path of the war god.
 Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, an organization 
dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks 
and without hesitation.
 Personality Trait. You feel far more 
comfortable around animals than people.
 Ideal. You are driven to earn 
glory in battle.
 Bond.  You have sworn to bring terrible 
wrath down on evildoers.
 Flaw.  Violence is your answer to almost 
any challenge.
Half-Orc Traits
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Relentless Endurance (Recharges after 
a Long Rest). When you are reduced to 0 
hit points but not killed outright, you can 
drop to 1 hit point instead.Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of 
the following options.
 Abjure Enemy. As an action, you 
present your holy symbol and speak 
a prayer of denunciation. Choose one 
creature within 60 feet of you that you 
can see. That creature must make a 
DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, unless it 
is immune to being frightened. Fiends 
and undead have disadvantage on this 
saving throw. 
 On a failed save, the creature is 
frightened for 1 minute or until it takes 
any damage. While frightened, the 
creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit 
from any bonus to its speed.
 On a successful save, the creature’s 
speed is halved for 1 minute or until the 
creature takes any damage.
 Vow of Enmity.  As a bonus action, 
you can utter a vow of enmity against 
a creature you can see within 10 feet 
of you. You gain advantage on attack 
rolls against the creature for 1 minute 
or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls 
unconscious.Character Name

Content: 	 Deflect	Missiles.	 When you are hit by a 
ranged weapon attack, you can use your 
reaction to reduce the damage you take 
from the attack by 1d10 + 8.
 If you reduce the damage to 0, you can 
catch the missile if it is small enough for 
you to hold in one hand and you have at 
least one hand free. If you catch a missile 
in this way, you can spend 1 ki point 
to make a ranged attack with what you 
caught, as part of the same reaction. You 
make this attack with proficiency, and 
the missile counts as a monk weapon 
for the attack.
	 Flurry	of	Blows.	 Immediately after 
you take the Attack action on your turn, 
you can spend 1 ki point to make two 
unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
 Whenever you hit a creature with one of 
these attacks, you can impose one of the 
following three effects on that target:
• It must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity 
saving throw or be knocked prone.
• It must succeed on a DC 13 Strength 
saving throw, or you can push it up to 
15 feet away from you.Halfling 
Monk 4
“Size	of	the	body	indicates	
nothing	of	the	depth	of	the	spirit.”
Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the 
cruel and wicked, especially those who 
harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.
Background (Acolyte)
You spent your formative years in a 
monastery dedicated to the Triad—Torm, 
Tyr, and primarily for your order, Ilmater, 
god of endurance and martyrdom. As 
a priest, you can perform sacred rites, 
including counseling and aiding others.
 Shelter of the Faithful. You and your 
companions can receive aid at any site 
dedicated to the Triad or its member 
deities, especially Ilmater. You must 
provide any material components for 
spells cast on your behalf. Those who 
share your religion support you at a 
modest lifestyle.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, seekers of justice 
who protect others from evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can find 
common ground between the fiercest 
enemies, empathizing with them and 
always working toward peace.
 Ideal. You always try to help those in 
need, no matter what the personal cost.
 Bond.  Everything you do is to protect 
the common folk.
 Flaw.  You place too much trust in those 
who profess to share your faith.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness.  You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, you 
can reroll the die and use the new roll.
Monk Features
Ki (Recharges after You Finish a Short 
or Long Rest). You have 4 ki points, 
which you can spend on ki features (listed 
under this feature). You must spend at 
least 30 minutes of a rest meditating to 
regain them.• It can’t take reactions until the end of 
your next turn.
	 Patient	Defense.  You can spend 1 
ki point to take the Dodge action as a 
bonus action.
	 Step	of	the	Wind.	 You can spend 
1 ki point to take the Disengage or 
Dash action as a bonus action. If you 
do so, your jump distance is doubled 
for the turn.
Martial Arts. When you use the Attack 
action with an unarmed strike or a monk 
weapon on your turn, you can make one 
unarmed strike as a bonus action.
Slow Fall. You can use your reaction to 
reduce falling damage you take by 20.
Unarmored Defense. While you wear

Content: Relentless Endurance (Recharges after 
a Long Rest). When you are reduced to 0 
hit points but not killed outright, you can 
drop to 1 hit point instead.
Savage Attacks. When you score a 
critical hit with a melee weapon attack, 
you can roll one of the weapon’s damage 
dice one additional time and add it to the 
extra damage of the critical hit.
Paladin Features
Divine Sense (3; Recharges after a 
Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any 
celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 
feet of you that is not behind total cover. 
You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. 
Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as 
with the hallow  spell.
 You can use this feature a 
number of times equal to 1 + your 
Charisma modifier.Half-Orc 
Paladin 2
“I might not be lovely to look 
upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”
Fury and resentment lie always just 
below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid, 
you were abandoned at a nearby temple 
and raised by the acolytes within. Despite 
the peaceful nature of their worship, your 
innate anger and resentment led you to 
the path of the war god.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, an organization 
dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks 
and without hesitation.
 Personality Trait. You feel far more 
comfortable around animals than people.
 Ideal. You are driven to earn 
glory in battle.
 Bond.  You have sworn to bring terrible 
wrath down on evildoers.
 Flaw.  Violence is your answer to almost 
any challenge.
Half-Orc Traits
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.Divine Smite. When you hit a creature 
with a melee weapon attack, you can 
expend one paladin spell slot to deal an 
extra 2d8 radiant damage to the target 
(3d8 radiant damage if it is an undead 
or a fiend).
Great Weapon Fighting. When you roll 
a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack 
you make with a melee weapon that you 
are wielding with two hands, you can 
reroll the die and must use the new roll. 
The weapon must have the two-handed 
or versatile property for you to gain 
this benefit.
Lay on Hands. You have a pool of healing 
power, with which you can restore up to 
10 hit points. This pool replenishes after 
you finish a long rest.
 As an action, you can touch a creature 
and draw power from the pool to restore 
a number of hit points to that creature, 
up to the maximum amount remaining 
in your pool.
 Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit 
points from your pool of healing to cure 
the target of one disease or neutralize Character Name

you. That creature gains one Bardic 
Inspiration die, a d6.
 Once within the next 10 minutes, 
the creature can roll the die and add 
the number rolled to one ability check,

Bard 4
“It seems I struck a chord. Ha! I 
love that one.”
The life of a vagabond is the 
only life you’ve ever known, and 
your various talents have rarely failed to 
provide you a warm bed and a hot supper. 
But mere survival is not enough anymore. 
You have discovered the hidden magic of 
words and music, and it is time for you 
to weave yourself into the stories told 
in hushed tones over steaming drinks, 
inspiring wonder in their listeners.
Background (Entertainer)
You have been the center of attention 
since before you could walk, and once 
you learned to sing and play, you never 
surrendered the spotlight again. And who 
deserves it more than you?
 By Popular Demand. You can always 
find a place to perform. You receive 
free lodging and food of a modest or 
comfortable standard as long as you 
perform each night. When strangers 
recognize you in a town where you 
have performed, they typically take a 
liking to you.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine organization who 
work against tyranny through the sharing 
of information and lore.
 Personality Trait. You change your 
mood or your mind as quickly as you 
change key in a song.
 Ideal. When you perform, you make the 
world better than it was.
 Bond.  You will do anything to prove 
yourself superior to your hated rival.
 Flaw.  You’re a sucker for a pretty face.

saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.

light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness,

ability to cast spells. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for your bard spells. 
You use your Charisma whenever a spell

finish a long rest.
Jack of All Trades. You can add half 
your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to 
any ability check you make that doesn’t 
already include your proficiency bonus.
Song of Rest. You can use soothing 
music or oration to help revitalize 
your wounded allies. If you or any 
friendly creatures who can hear your 
performance regain hit points at the end 
of a short rest, each of those creatures

“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger.

Evocation Savant. The gold and time you

Sculpt Spells. You can create pockets 
of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can 
choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures 
automatically succeed on their saving 
throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would take half damage on a successful save.Potent Cantrip. Your damaging cantrips 
affect even creatures that avoid the brunt 
of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s 
damage (if any) but suffers no additional 
effect from the cantrip.

--- Chunk 218 ---
Content:  Cantrips. You know two cantrips, which 
you can cast at will.
 Preparing and Casting Spells. To cast 
one of your druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
 You prepare the list of druid spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose up to six druid spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. 
When you prepare new spells, you must meditate 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
 Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your druid spells, 
since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You 
use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers 
to your spellcasting ability.Human Druid 3
“All things have a spirit within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
Wild Shape (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can take a bonus action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen 
before, provided that the beast has a 
challenge rating of 1, or lower, and has no flying speed. You can use this feature twice.
 You can stay in a beast shape for 1 
hour, and then you revert to your normal 
form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus 
action. You automatically revert if you fall 
unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

 Wild Shape (cont’d). While you are 
transformed, the following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by 
the statistics of the beast, but you 
retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill 
and saving throw proficiencies, in addi -
tion to gaining those of the creature. If 
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s 
bonus instead of yours. If the creature 
has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
• When you transform, you assume the 
beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When 
you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you 
had before you transformed. However, 
if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to 
speak or take any action that requires 
hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell 
you’ve already cast, however, or prevent 
you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source 
and can use them if the new form 
is physically capable of doing so. However, your senses are replaced by those of the beast.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it 
is practical for the new form to wear a 
piece of equipment, based on the crea -
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either 
fall to the ground or merge with it. 
Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
 Combat Wild Shape. While you are 
transformed, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

Barbarian 4
“The wild is in my blood.”
Hailing from the northern 
lands, you are a stranger to 
civilization. Yet you travel 
wherever need guides you,  
fighting those who would despoil the 
wilderness. You have faced encroaching 
evil from monsters to greedy humans. 
You take what you need, and feed the 
ground with the blood of such enemies.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up among tribal nomads, 
far from civilization and its comforts. 
You’ve hunted great herds, survived 
extreme weather, raided the trade of 
softer folk, and protected places sacred 
to your people. At times, you’ve enjoyed 
the solitude of being the only sentient 
creature for miles in any direction. Even 
in places where the terrain is new, you 
know the ways of the wild.
 Wanderer. As a former barbarian 
nomad and raider, you have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers enough.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats.
 Personality Trait. You place no stock 
in refined manners or wealth.
 Ideal. Life is constant change, and you 
must change with it to survive.
 Bond.  You take the despoiling of 
the wilderness and sacred sites as a 
personal insult.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.

Dexterity saving throws against effects

--- Chunk 221 ---
Content: Cleric Features
Channel Divinity (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can channel divine energy to create one of the 
following effects. You can do so twice.
 Preserve Life. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore up to 45 hit points. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points 
among them. This feature can restore 
a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.
 Turn Undead. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and speak a prayer 
censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving 
throw or become turned for 1 minute or 
until it takes any damage. If the creature has a challenge rating of 1 or lower, it is destroyed instead.Dwarf Cleric 9
“By Moradin’s hammer, be made whole!”
Although you started out as 
an artisan, you heard the 
voice of the dwarven deities 
in the stones you carved and metal you shaped. Your acts of artistry became acts of reverence, causing you 
to desire to exemplify the inner nature of 
your people. You joined the clergy, and your pure dwarven desires allowed you to connect to the divine.
Background  (Guild Jeweler)
Before you became devoted to the dwarven deities, you were a journeyman jeweler and gem cutter. Even outside your 
home, you are recognized by your badge 
and skill. You have the aid of a loose coalition of guilds, and one day you shall 
become a master your own right. Seeking 
such mastery is an act of worship to you. Guild Member. Fellow guild members 
can provide you with necessities, and 
the guild can use its political power to 
aid you. In some areas, a guildhall offers a place to meet other members of your profession and those who aid the guild. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month 
to the guild. If you miss payments, you 
must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lords’ Alliance, a loose coalition of established political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. A perfectionist, you 
demand a lot from yourself and expect 
the most from others. 
 Ideal. It is the duty of civilized people to 
strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization.
 Bond. You aim to prove you are the 
greatest artisan of them all. Flaw.  You are greedy. So you can’t part 
with money easily, and you haggle to get the best possible deal.
Dwarf Features
Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Stonecunning. You have a +8 bonus on 
Intelligence (History) checks related to 
the origin of stonework. A turned creature must spend its turns 
trying to move as far away from you as it 
can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only 
the Dash action or try to escape from 
an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
Life Domain. The Life domain focuses 
on the vibrant positive energy—one of 
the fundamental forces of the universe—
that sustains all life. You gain a number of domain spells, which are always considered to be prepared, as a result of 
this domain. In addition, you have access 
to the following features: Blessed Healer. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, 
you regain hit points equal to 2 + the 
spell’s level.

Life Domain (cont’d). 
 Disciple of Life. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit 
points to a creature, the creature regains 
additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level. Divine Strike. Once on each of your 
turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to 
shape that essence to your will. Cantrips. You know four cantrips, 
which you can cast at will.
 Preparing and Casting Spells. To cast 
one of your cleric spells, you must expend 
a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
 You prepare the list of cleric spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose up to thirteen cleric spells. The 
spells must be of a level for which you 
have spell slots. You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. When you prepare new spells, you must pray 
for 1 minute per spell level for each spell 
on your list. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your cleric 
spells, since your magic draws upon 
your devotion to the dwarven deities, especially Moradin. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
 Ritual Casting. You can cast a cleric 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual 
tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a holy 
symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

Content: Cleric Features
Channel Divinity (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can channel divine energy to create one of the 
following effects. You can do so twice.
 Preserve Life. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore up to 40 hit 
points. Choose any creatures within 30 
feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this 
feature on an undead or a construct.
 Turn Undead. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that 
can see or hear you within 30 feet of you 
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. If the creature has a challenge rating of 1 or lower, it is 
destroyed instead.Dwarf Cleric 8
“By Moradin’s hammer, be 
made whole!”
Although you started out as 
an artisan, you heard the 
voice of the dwarven deities 
in the stones you carved and metal you shaped. Your acts of artistry became acts of reverence, causing you 
to desire to exemplify the inner nature of 
your people. You joined the clergy, and your pure dwarven desires allowed you to connect to the divine.
Background  (Guild Jeweler)
Before you became devoted to the dwarven deities, you were a journeyman jeweler and gem cutter. Even outside your 
home, you are recognized by your badge 
and skill. You have the aid of a loose coalition of guilds, and one day you shall 
become a master your own right. Seeking 
such mastery is an act of worship to you. Guild Member. Fellow guild members 
can provide you with necessities, and 
the guild can use its political power to 
aid you. In some areas, a guildhall offers a place to meet other members of your profession and those who aid the guild. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month 
to the guild. If you miss payments, you 
must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lords’ Alliance, a loose coalition of established political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. A perfectionist, you 
demand a lot from yourself and expect 
the most from others. 
 Ideal. It is the duty of civilized people to 
strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization.
 Bond. You aim to prove you are the 
greatest artisan of them all. Flaw.  You are greedy. So you can’t part 
with money easily, and you haggle to get the best possible deal.
Dwarf Features
Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Stonecunning. You have a +6 bonus on 
Intelligence (History) checks related to 
the origin of stonework. A turned creature must spend its turns 
trying to move as far away from you as it 
can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only 
the Dash action or try to escape from 
an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.
Life Domain. The Life domain focuses 
on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. You gain a number of domain spells, which are always 
considered to be prepared, as a result of 
this domain. In addition, you have access to the following features: Blessed Healer. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to 
the damage roll.
• You have resistance to bludgeoning, 
piercing, and slashing damage.
• You can make a single melee weapon 
attack as a bonus action. If you do so,

Barbarian 5
“The wild is in my blood.”
Hailing from the northern 
lands, you are a stranger to 
civilization. Yet you travel 
wherever need guides you,  
fighting those who would despoil the 
wilderness. You have faced encroaching 
evil from monsters to greedy humans. 
You take what you need, and feed the 
ground with the blood of such enemies.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up among tribal nomads, 
far from civilization and its comforts. 
You’ve hunted great herds, survived 
extreme weather, raided the trade of 
softer folk, and protected places sacred 
to your people. At times, you’ve enjoyed 
the solitude of being the only sentient 
creature for miles in any direction. Even 
in places where the terrain is new, you 
know the ways of the wild.
 Wanderer. As a former barbarian 
nomad and raider, you have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers enough.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats.
 Personality Trait. You place no stock 
in refined manners or wealth.
 Ideal. Life is constant change, and you 
must change with it to survive.
 Bond.  You take the despoiling of 
the wilderness and sacred sites as a 
personal insult.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.
Barbarian Features
Danger Sense.  You have advantage on 
Dexterity saving throws against effects 
that you can see. To gain this benefit, 
you can’t be blinded, deafened, or 
incapacitated.
Fast Movement.  Your speed increases 
by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing 
heavy armor.
Rage (Recharges after You Finish a 
Long Rest). Three times, you can enter a 
rage as a bonus action. While raging, the 
following parameters apply:Unarmored Defense. While you are 
wearing no armor, but even if you’re 
using a shield, your Armor Class equals 
10 + your Dexterity modifier + your 
Constitution modifier.

“All things have a spirit within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as 
a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.
Wild Shape (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can take a bonus action to magically assume 
the shape of a beast that you have seen 
before, provided that the beast has a challenge rating of 1, or lower, and has no flying speed. You can use this feature twice.
 You can stay in a beast shape for 1 
hour, and then you revert to your normal 
form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your 
normal form earlier by using a bonus 
action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

 Wild Shape (cont’d). While you are 
transformed, the following rules apply:
• Your game statistics are replaced by 
the statistics of the beast, but you 
retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill 
and saving throw proficiencies, in addi -
tion to gaining those of the creature. If 
the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s 
bonus instead of yours. If the creature 
has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.
• When you transform, you assume the 
beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When 
you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you 
had before you transformed. However, 
if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.
• You can’t cast spells, and your ability to 
speak or take any action that requires 
hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell 
you’ve already cast, however, or prevent 
you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you’ve already cast.
• You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source 
and can use them if the new form 
is physically capable of doing so. However, your senses are replaced by those of the beast.
• You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it 
is practical for the new form to wear a 
piece of equipment, based on the crea -
ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either 
fall to the ground or merge with it. 
Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
 Combat Wild Shape. While you are 
transformed, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.

Bardic Inspiration. You may use a

one creature other than yourself 
within 60 feet of you who can hear 
you. That creature gains one Bardic 
Inspiration die, a d8.
 Once within the next 10 minutes, 
the creature can roll the die and add 
the number rolled to one ability check,

creature can wait until after it rolls the

Bard 5
“It seems I struck a chord. Ha! I 
love that one.”
The life of a vagabond is the 
only life you’ve ever known, and 
your various talents have rarely failed to 
provide you a warm bed and a hot supper. 
But mere survival is not enough anymore. 
You have discovered the hidden magic of 
words and music, and it is time for you 
to weave yourself into the stories told 
in hushed tones over steaming drinks, 
inspiring wonder in their listeners.
Background (Entertainer)
You have been the center of attention 
since before you could walk, and once 
you learned to sing and play, you never 
surrendered the spotlight again. And who 
deserves it more than you?
 By Popular Demand. You can always 
find a place to perform. You receive 
free lodging and food of a modest or 
comfortable standard as long as you 
perform each night. When strangers 
recognize you in a town where you 
have performed, they typically take a 
liking to you.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine organization who 
work against tyranny through the sharing 
of information and lore.
 Personality Trait. You change your 
mood or your mind as quickly as you 
change key in a song.
 Ideal. When you perform, you make the 
world better than it was.
 Bond.  You will do anything to prove 
yourself superior to your hated rival.
 Flaw.  You’re a sucker for a pretty face.
Half-elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright 
light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Bard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the 
ability to cast spells. Charisma is your 
spellcasting ability for your bard spells. 
You use your Charisma whenever a spell 
refers to your spellcasting ability. You can use this feature 4 times. You 
regain any expended uses when you 
finish a short or long rest.
Jack of All Trades. You can add half 
your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to 
any ability check you make that doesn’t 
already include your proficiency bonus.
Song of Rest. You can use soothing 
music or oration to help revitalize 
your wounded allies. If you or any 
friendly creatures who can hear your 
performance regain hit points at the end 
of a short rest, each of those creatures 
regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

Lore
Cutting Words. When a creature that you 
can see within 60 feet of you makes an 
attack roll, an ability check, or a damage 
roll, you can use your reaction to expend 
one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, 
rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and 
subtracting the number rolled from the 
creature’s roll. You can choose to use this 
feature after the creature makes its roll, 
but before the DM determines whether

or fails, or before the creature deals Character Name

Content: High Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.
Wizard Features
Spellcasting Abiiity. You have the 
ability to cast spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells. 
You use your Intelligence whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You prepare the list of wizard spells 
that are available for you to cast. To do so, 
choose 13 spells. The spells must be of a 
level for which you have spell slots. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.
 You can use an arcane focus as a 
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. You can cast any wizard spell in your 
spellbook as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.Elf Wizard 8
“So you clothe yourself in steel and cured leather, jab pointy sticks at your enemies, and 
think yourself mighty? Fool. My 
weapons are the building blocks of creation, the forces of the universe. Seek not to impress me with muscle and 
bone.”
Little about your demeanor or 
appearance would suggest that you are a professional adventurer. Your fine clothes are evidence of your privileged upbringing, your speech hints at your 
impressive education. Yet adventure 
is the surest, if cruelest, method of refining your arcane skills, as adversity traditionally allows one to reap the 
greatest benefits. Let those of limited 
scope spend their time poring over worn tomes from the safety of a library. You crave the arcane knowledge of past eons 
long forgotten, and the means to acheive 
the heights of untold glory of which you have always dreamed.
Background (Noble)
You were raised wanting for nothing, giving you a clarity of purpose that outweighs pedestrian survival. You 
know that your potential is limitless, 
and you aim to make use of your gods-given talents. Position of Privilege. You are welcome 
in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high 
birth treat you as a member of the 
same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political 
powers concerned with mutual security 
and prosperity.
 Personality Trait. No one could doubt 
by looking at your regal bearing that you are a cut above the unwashed masses.
 Ideal. It is your duty to protect and care 
for the people beneath you.
 Bond. The common folk must see you as a hero of the people. Flaw.  You too often hear veiled insults 
and threats in every word addressed to you, and you are quick to anger. Spell Save DC: 16
 Spell Attack Modifier: +8
 Spell Slots: 1st-level (4), 2nd-level (3), 
3rd-level (3), 4th-level (2)Arcane Recovery. Once per day when 
you finish a short rest, you can choose 
expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to or less than 4.
Arcane Tradition: School of 
Evocation
Evocation Savant. The gold and time you 
must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.
Sculpt Spells. You can create pockets 
of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other 
creatures that you can see, you can 
choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no 
damage if they would take half damage 
on a successful save.Potent Cantrip. Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt 
of the effect. When a creature succeeds 
on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

Sorcerer 10
“Do you hear that? It is the 
roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.
 Despite your self-sufficiency, you 
tire of a life alone. Your clan is far, but 
these companions are the closest thing 
to a tribe. As long as they can prove 
themselves worthy of your company, you 
will travel with them.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, a fiercely 
proud member of a noble clan. The clan 
outweighs everything else in your life, 
even the stated law of the land.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of 
the Emerald Enclave, defenders of 
the wild lands.
 Personality Trait. You once ran 
25 miles to warn your clan of an 
approaching threat, and you’d do 
the same again.
 Ideal. To dishonor yourself is to 
dishonor the clan.
 Bond.  Your clan is the most important 
thing in your life, even when they are 
far from you.
 Flaw.  It is nature’s way that the strong 
survive and the weak perish.

 As a bonus action on your turn, you can

of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level.
 Metamagic. You have the following 
Metamagic options. You can use only one 
Metamagic option on a spell when you 
cast it, unless otherwise noted.
 Careful Spell: When you cast a spell 
that forces other creatures to make a 
saving throw, you can protect some of 
those creatures from the spell’s full force. 
To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and 
choose a number of those creatures up 
to your Charisma modifier (a minimum 
of one creature). A chosen creature 
automatially succeeds on its saving throw 
against the spell.
 Distant Spell: When you cast a spell 
that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you 
can spend 1 sorcery points to double the 
range of the spell.
 When you cast a spell that has a range 
of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to 
make the range of the spell 30 feet.
 Empowered Spell: When you roll 
damage for a spell, you can spend 1 
sorcery point to reroll a number of 
the damage dice up to your Charisma 
modifier (minimum of one). You must use 
the new rolls.
 You can use Empowered Spell even 
if you have already used a different 
Metamagic option during the casting 
of the spell.

Paladin Features
Divine Sense (3; Recharges after a 
Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any 
celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 
feet of you that is not behind total cover. 
You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. 
Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as 
with the hallow  spell.
 You can use this feature a 
number of times equal to 1 + your 
Charisma modifier.Half-Orc 
Paladin 3
“I might not be lovely to look 
upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”
Fury and resentment lie always just 
below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid, 
you were abandoned at a nearby temple 
and raised by the acolytes within. Despite 
the peaceful nature of their worship, your 
innate anger and resentment led you to 
the path of the war god.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, an organization 
dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks 
and without hesitation.
 Personality Trait. You feel far more 
comfortable around animals than people.
 Ideal. You are driven to earn 
glory in battle.
 Bond.  You have sworn to bring terrible 
wrath down on evildoers.
 Flaw.  Violence is your answer to almost 
any challenge.
Half-Orc Traits
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Relentless Endurance (Recharges after 
a Long Rest). When you are reduced to 0 
hit points but not killed outright, you can 
drop to 1 hit point instead.Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of 
the following options.
 Abjure Enemy. As an action, you 
present your holy symbol and speak 
a prayer of denunciation. Choose one 
creature within 60 feet of you that you 
can see. That creature must make a 
DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, unless it 
is immune to being frightened. Fiends 
and undead have disadvantage on this 
saving throw. 
 On a failed save, the creature is 
frightened for 1 minute or until it takes 
any damage. While frightened, the 
creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit 
from any bonus to its speed.
 On a successful save, the creature’s 
speed is halved for 1 minute or until the 
creature takes any damage.
 Vow of Enmity.  As a bonus action, 
you can utter a vow of enmity against 
a creature you can see within 10 feet 
of you. You gain advantage on attack 
rolls against the creature for 1 minute 
or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls 
unconscious.Character Name

Content: 	 Deflect	Missiles.	 When you are hit by a 
ranged weapon attack, you can use your 
reaction to reduce the damage you take 
from the attack by 1d10 + 9.
 If you reduce the damage to 0, you can 
catch the missile if it is small enough for 
you to hold in one hand and you have at 
least one hand free. If you catch a missile 
in this way, you can spend 1 ki point 
to make a ranged attack with what you 
caught, as part of the same reaction. You 
make this attack with proficiency, and 
the missile counts as a monk weapon 
for the attack.

Monk 5
“Size	of	the	body	indicates	
nothing	of	the	depth	of	the	spirit.”
Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the 
cruel and wicked, especially those who 
harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.

including counseling and aiding others.
 Shelter of the Faithful. You and your 
companions can receive aid at any site

modest lifestyle.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, seekers of justice 
who protect others from evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can find 
common ground between the fiercest 
enemies, empathizing with them and 
always working toward peace.
 Ideal. You always try to help those in 
need, no matter what the personal cost.
 Bond.  Everything you do is to protect 
the common folk.
 Flaw.  You place too much trust in those 
who profess to share your faith.

can reroll the die and use the new roll.

Monk 7
“Size	of	the	body	indicates	
nothing	of	the	depth	of	the	spirit.”
Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the 
cruel and wicked, especially those who 
harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.
Background (Acolyte)
You spent your formative years in a 
monastery dedicated to the Triad—Torm, 
Tyr, and primarily for your order, Ilmater, 
god of endurance and martyrdom. As 
a priest, you can perform sacred rites, 
including counseling and aiding others.
 Shelter of the Faithful. You and your 
companions can receive aid at any site 
dedicated to the Triad or its member 
deities, especially Ilmater. You must 
provide any material components for 
spells cast on your behalf. Those who 
share your religion support you at a 
modest lifestyle.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, seekers of justice 
who protect others from evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can find 
common ground between the fiercest 
enemies, empathizing with them and 
always working toward peace.
 Ideal. You always try to help those in 
need, no matter what the personal cost.
 Bond.  Everything you do is to protect 
the common folk.
 Flaw.  You place too much trust in those 
who profess to share your faith.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness.  You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, you 
can reroll the die and use the new roll.
Monk Features
Evasion. When you are subjected to an 
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity 
saving throw to take only half damage, 
you instead take no damage if you 
succeed on the saving throw, and only 
half damage if you fail. Whenever you hit a creature with one of 
these attacks, you can impose one of the 
following three effects on that target:
• It must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity 
saving throw or be knocked prone.
• It must succeed on a DC 13 Strength 
saving throw, or you can push it up to 
15 feet away from you.
• It can’t take reactions until the end of 
your next turn.
	 Patient	Defense.  You can spend 1 
ki point to take the Dodge action as a 
bonus action.
	 Step	of	the	Wind.	 You can spend 
1 ki point to take the Disengage or 
Dash action as a bonus action. If you 
do so, your jump distance is doubled 
for the turn.
	 Stunning	Strike.	 When you hit another 
creature with a melee weapon attack, 
you can spend 1 ki point. If you do so, 
the target must succeed on a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw or be stunned 
until the end of your next turn.Character Name

dice one additional time and add it to the 
extra damage of the critical hit.
Paladin Features
Divine Sense (3; Recharges after a 
Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any 
celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 
feet of you that is not behind total cover. 
You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. 
Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as 
with the hallow  spell.
 You can use this feature a 
number of times equal to 1 + your 
Charisma modifier.
Lay on Hands. You have a pool of healing 
power, with which you can restore up to 5 
hit points. This pool replenishes after you

Paladin 1
“I might not be lovely to look 
upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”
Fury and resentment lie always just 
below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid, 
you were abandoned at a nearby temple 
and raised by the acolytes within. Despite 
the peaceful nature of their worship, your 
innate anger and resentment led you to 
the path of the war god.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, an organization 
dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks 
and without hesitation.
 Personality Trait. You feel far more 
comfortable around animals than people.
 Ideal. You are driven to earn 
glory in battle.
 Bond.  You have sworn to bring terrible 
wrath down on evildoers.
 Flaw.  Violence is your answer to almost 
any challenge.
Half-Orc Traits
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Relentless Endurance (Recharges after 
a Long Rest). When you are reduced to 0 
hit points but not killed outright, you can 
drop to 1 hit point instead. As an action, you can touch a creature 
and draw power from the pool to restore 
a number of hit points to that creature, 
up to the maximum amount remaining 
in your pool.
 Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit 
points from your pool of healing to cure 
the target of one disease or neutralize 
one poison affecting it. You can cure 
multiple diseases and neutralize multiple 
poisons with a single use of Lay on 
Hands, expending hit points separately 
for each one.
 This feature has no effect on undead 
and constructs.

only life you’ve ever known, and 
your various talents have rarely failed to 
provide you a warm bed and a hot supper.

“The wild is in my blood.”
Hailing from the northern

evil from monsters to greedy humans. 
You take what you need, and feed the

You grew up among tribal nomads, 
far from civilization and its comforts. 
You’ve hunted great herds, survived 
extreme weather, raided the trade of 
softer folk, and protected places sacred 
to your people. At times, you’ve enjoyed 
the solitude of being the only sentient 
creature for miles in any direction. Even 
in places where the terrain is new, you 
know the ways of the wild.
 Wanderer. As a former barbarian 
nomad and raider, you have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers enough.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats.
 Personality Trait. You place no stock 
in refined manners or wealth.
 Ideal. Life is constant change, and you 
must change with it to survive.
 Bond.  You take the despoiling of 
the wilderness and sacred sites as a 
personal insult.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.
Barbarian Features
Danger Sense.  You have advantage on 
Dexterity saving throws against effects 
that you can see. To gain this benefit, 
you can’t be blinded, deafened, or 
incapacitated.
Fast Movement.  Your speed increases 
by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing 
heavy armor.• You can’t cast or concentrate on spells.
 Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends 
early if you are knocked unconscious or if 
your turn ends and you haven’t attacked 
a hostile creature since your last turn or 
taken damage since then. You can also 
end your rage as a bonus action.
Reckless Attack. When you make your 
first attack on your turn, you can decide 
to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you 
advantage on melee weapon attack rolls 
using Strength during this turn, but 
attack rolls against you have advantage 
until your next turn.
Unarmored Defense. While you are 
wearing no armor, but even if you’re 
using a shield, your Armor Class equals 
10 + your Dexterity modifier + your 
Constitution modifier.Character Name

“Measure twice, cut once. Or two 
or three times, whatever works. Maybe 
five.”
You crave adventure like most people 
crave food or drink. You lived in any 
number of cities and villages during your 
time with the military, but no one place 
has ever truly felt like home–and you 
have slowly come to the conclusion that 
this is according to your preferences. 
Background (Soldier)
You were a professional soldier. You 
traveled to foreign lands, led troops into 
danger, fought wars under the banners 
of different commanders. Yet, you craved 
something more out of life, and resigned 
your commission. Now you are out on 
your own, living by your wits, taking 
orders from no one.
 Military Rank. You were a low-ranked 
officer in a military organization. Soldiers 
loyal to your former military organization 
still recognize your authority and 
influence, and they defer to you if they are 
of a lower rank.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and 
vigilant group that seeks to protect others 
from the depredations of evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can stare down 
a hell hound without flinching.
 Ideal. When people follow orders 
blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny.
 Bond.  You fight for those who cannot 
fight for themselves.
 Flaw.  You’d rather eat your armor than 
admit when you’re wrong.
Fighter Features

creature you can see attacks a target

Content:  Cantrips. You know two cantrips, which 
you can cast at will.
 Preparing and Casting Spells. To cast 
one of your druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
 You prepare the list of druid spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing 
from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose up to four druid spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have 
spell slots.
 You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. When you prepare new spells, you must 
meditate 1 minute per spell level for each 
spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your 
devotion and attunement to nature. You 
use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.Human Druid 1
“All things have a spirit within. My spirit is my strength.”
You were born in a sacred 
natural place, and you were 
marked from birth with supernatural gifts. Although your parents were farmers, your presence was a 
blessing to them and your village. The 
druids of the circle overseeing the land near your home tutored you from a young age, allowing you to eschew the normal life a farm child. You became able to shift 
your form when you entered puberty. 
Although your build is slight, your powers of spirit grant you all the might you need.
Background (Folk Hero)
You come from among the peasantry, but the druids who taught you revealed your birth is in accord with a prophecy spoken 
long ago by mysterious fey. People of your 
home village regard you as a blessed one with the skills to stand against threats against common folk everywhere.
 Rustic Hospitality. You can find a 
place to hide, rest, or recuperate among 
commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else 
searching for you, though they will not 
risk their lives for you. Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, wilderness survivalists 
who preserve the natural order while 
rooting out unnatural threats. Personality Trait. You judge people 
by their actions, testing them with strong words.
 Ideal. Traditional ways, when wise and 
good, should be upheld.
 Bond. Everything you do is to serve and protect the common folk.
 Flaw.  Convinced of the import of 
your destiny, you are blind to your shortcomings and the risk of failure.
Druid Features
Druidic. You can speak Druidic and 
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language 
automatically spot such a message. 
Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can decipher it only with magic.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. Ritual Casting. You can cast a druid 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a 
druidic focus, such as your yew wand, as 
a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

you. That creature gains one Bardic 
Inspiration die, a d8.

love that one.”
The life of a vagabond is the 
only life you’ve ever known, and 
your various talents have rarely failed to 
provide you a warm bed and a hot supper. 
But mere survival is not enough anymore. 
You have discovered the hidden magic of 
words and music, and it is time for you 
to weave yourself into the stories told 
in hushed tones over steaming drinks, 
inspiring wonder in their listeners.
Background (Entertainer)
You have been the center of attention 
since before you could walk, and once 
you learned to sing and play, you never 
surrendered the spotlight again. And who 
deserves it more than you?
 By Popular Demand. You can always 
find a place to perform. You receive 
free lodging and food of a modest or 
comfortable standard as long as you 
perform each night. When strangers 
recognize you in a town where you 
have performed, they typically take a 
liking to you.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine organization who 
work against tyranny through the sharing 
of information and lore.
 Personality Trait. You change your 
mood or your mind as quickly as you 
change key in a song.
 Ideal. When you perform, you make the 
world better than it was.
 Bond.  You will do anything to prove 
yourself superior to your hated rival.

saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.

light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.

regains an extra 1d6 hit points.
Countercharm. You can use musical 
notes or words of power to disrupt 
mind-influencing effects. As an action,

Content: 	 Deflect	Missiles.	 When you are hit by a 
ranged weapon attack, you can use your 
reaction to reduce the damage you take 
from the attack by 1d10 + 10.
 If you reduce the damage to 0, you can 
catch the missile if it is small enough for 
you to hold in one hand and you have at 
least one hand free. If you catch a missile 
in this way, you can spend 1 ki point 
to make a ranged attack with what you 
caught, as part of the same reaction. You 
make this attack with proficiency, and 
the missile counts as a monk weapon 
for the attack.
	 Flurry	of	Blows.	 Immediately after 
you take the Attack action on your turn, 
you can spend 1 ki point to make two 
unarmed strikes as a bonus action.
 Whenever you hit a creature with one of

following three effects on that target:
• It must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity 
saving throw or be knocked prone.
• It must succeed on a DC 13 Strength

nothing	of	the	depth	of	the	spirit.”
Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the 
cruel and wicked, especially those who 
harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.

“Could you keep the screaming 
down a bit? I’m kinda busy here.”
You’re completely self-sufficient. If you 
need something, you take it. If someone 
else has it, they don’t anymore. Necessity 
trumps silly laws of possession.
 You weren’t a desperate orphan, 
scratching out a living on the mean

a history of breaking the law. You have

and trustworthy contact who acts 
as your liaison to a loose network of 
other criminals. (This is not a formal 
organization like the Zhentarim.) You 
know how to get messages to and from 
your contact, even over great distances, 
using local messnegers, corrupt caravan 
masters, and seedy sailors.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine network of 
spellcasters and spies that seeks to tip 
the scales in favor of the innocent, the 
weak, and the poor.
 Personality Trait. You are always 
calm, no matter what the situation.
 Ideal. Everyone should be free to

how to steal it.

of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.
Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 5d6 damage to one 
creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

Rogue 8
“Could you keep the screaming 
down a bit? I’m kinda busy here.”
You’re completely self-sufficient. If you 
need something, you take it. If someone 
else has it, they don’t anymore. Necessity 
trumps silly laws of possession.
 You weren’t a desperate orphan, 
scratching out a living on the mean 
streets. Neither were you a noble 
poser, slumming for excitement. No, 
you are a master of adaptation to your 
environment—be it urban, dungeon, 
or the wild.
Background (Criminal)
You are an experienced criminal with 
a history of breaking the law. You have 
spent a lot of time among other criminals 
and still have contacts within the 
criminal underworld. You have survived 
up to this point by flouting the rules and 
regulations of society.
 Your expertise is burglary. You are 
unmatched at getting into tight spaces 
and locked rooms, and getting back out 
again richer and none the worse. 
 Criminal Contact. You have a reliable 
and trustworthy contact who acts 
as your liaison to a loose network of 
other criminals. (This is not a formal 
organization like the Zhentarim.) You 
know how to get messages to and from 
your contact, even over great distances, 
using local messnegers, corrupt caravan 
masters, and seedy sailors.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Harpers, a clandestine network of 
spellcasters and spies that seeks to tip 
the scales in favor of the innocent, the 
weak, and the poor.
 Personality Trait. You are always 
calm, no matter what the situation.
 Ideal. Everyone should be free to 
pursue his or her own livelihood.
 Bond.  You are loyal to your friends, not 
to any ideals.
 Flaw.  When you see something 
valuable, you can’t think of anything but 
how to steal it.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness. You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, 
you can reroll the die and must use 
the new roll.succeed on the saving throw, and only 
half damage if you fail.
Second-Story Work. Climbing does not 
cost you extra movement. In addition, 
when you make a running jump, the 
distance you cover increases by a number 
of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.
Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 4d6 damage to one 
creature you hit with an attack if you have 
advantage on the attack roll. The attack 
must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
 You don’t need advantage on the 
attack roll if another enemy of the 
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy 
isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have 
disadvantage on the attack roll.
Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that 
you can see hits you with an attack, you 
can use your reaction to halve the attack’s 
damage against you.Character Name

“It seems I struck a chord. Ha! I 
love that one.”
The life of a vagabond is the 
only life you’ve ever known, and 
your various talents have rarely failed to 
provide you a warm bed and a hot supper. 
But mere survival is not enough anymore. 
You have discovered the hidden magic of 
words and music, and it is time for you 
to weave yourself into the stories told 
in hushed tones over steaming drinks, 
inspiring wonder in their listeners.

Favored Enemy. You have significant 
experience studying, tracking, hunting, 
and even talking to dragons and 
giants. You have advantage on Wisdom 
(Survival) checks to track dragons or 
giants, as well as on Intelligence checks 
to recall information about them.
Natural Explorer. You are particularly 
at home in forest or Underdark terrain. 
When you make an Intelligence or 
Wisdom check related to forest or 
Underdark terrain, your proficiency 
bonus is doubled if you are using a skill 
that you’re proficient in.
 While traveling for an hour or more in 
forest or Underdark terrain, you gain the 
following benefits:
• Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your 
group’s speed.
• Your group can’t become lost except by 
magical means.
• Even when you are engaged in another 
activity while traveling, you remain 
alert to danger.
• If you are traveling alone, you can move 
stealthily at a normal pace.
• When you forage, you find twice as 
much food as you normally would.Elf Ranger 8
“Once I choose my prey, I never 
lose the trail or miss my mark. 
The hunt is all.”
The last remaining member of 
your tribe, you are the epitome 
of the rugged individualist. You know 
better than to ascribe qualities such as 
mercy or bounty to the forests of your 
youth. There are a thousand ways to die 
in the wilderness, and you have survived 
through muscle, wits, and will.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, far from 
civilization and the comforts of town and 
technology. The wilds are in your blood. 
Even in places where you don’t know the 
specific features of the terrain, you know 
the way of the wild.
 Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, a group dedicated to 
maintaining the delicate balance between 
nature and civilization.
 Personality Trait. I once ran twenty-
five miles without stopping to warn my 
clan of an approaching orc horde. I’d do it 
again if I had to.
 Ideal. Life is like the seasons, 
in constant change, and we must 
change with it.
 Bond.  I am the last of my tribe, and 
it is up to me to ensure their names 
enter legend.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.
Wood Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright 
light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Mask of the Wild. You can attempt 
to hide even when you are only lightly 
obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling 
snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.• While tracking other creatures, you 
also learn their exact number, their 
sizes, and how long ago they passed 
through the area.
Fighting Style: Archery. You gain a 
+2 bonus to attack rolls you make with 
ranged weapons. (This is factored into 
the stat block.)
Spellcasting. You have the ability to cast 
spells. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability 
for your ranger spells. You use your 
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your 
spellcasting ability.
 To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.

Content: Cleric Features
Channel Divinity (Recharges after You 
Finish a Short or Long Rest). You can channel divine energy to create one of the 
following effects. You can do so twice.
 Preserve Life. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore up to 50 hit 
points. Choose any creatures within 30 
feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this 
feature on an undead or a construct.
 Turn Undead. As an action, you present 
your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that 
can see or hear you within 30 feet of you 
must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become turned for 1 minute or Dwarf Cleric 10
“By Moradin’s hammer, be made whole!”
Although you started out as 
an artisan, you heard the 
voice of the dwarven deities 
in the stones you carved and metal you shaped. Your acts of artistry became acts of reverence, causing you 
to desire to exemplify the inner nature of 
your people. You joined the clergy, and your pure dwarven desires allowed you to connect to the divine.
Background  (Guild Jeweler)
Before you became devoted to the dwarven deities, you were a journeyman jeweler and gem cutter. Even outside your 
home, you are recognized by your badge 
and skill. You have the aid of a loose coalition of guilds, and one day you shall 
become a master your own right. Seeking 
such mastery is an act of worship to you. Guild Member. Fellow guild members 
can provide you with necessities, and 
the guild can use its political power to 
aid you. In some areas, a guildhall offers a place to meet other members of your profession and those who aid the guild. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month 
to the guild. If you miss payments, you 
must make up back dues to remain in the guild’s good graces. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lords’ Alliance, a loose coalition of established political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. A perfectionist, you 
demand a lot from yourself and expect 
the most from others. 
 Ideal. It is the duty of civilized people to 
strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization.
 Bond. You aim to prove you are the 
greatest artisan of them all. Flaw.  You are greedy. So you can’t part 
with money easily, and you haggle to get the best possible deal.
Dwarf Features
Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Stonecunning. You have a +8 bonus on 
Intelligence (History) checks related to 
the origin of stonework.until it takes any damage. If the creature has a challenge rating of 1 or lower, it is 
destroyed instead. A turned creature must spend its turns 
trying to move as far away from you as it 
can, and it can’t willingly move to a space 
within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If 
there’s nowhere to move, the creature can 
use the Dodge action.
Divine Intervention. As your action, you 
pray, describing the assistance you seek, 
and roll percentile dice. If you roll 10 or 
lower, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention. If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, 
you can use it again after you finish 
a long rest.

Life Domain. The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—
that sustains all life. You gain a number 
of domain spells, which are always considered to be prepared, as a result of this domain. In addition, you have access 
to the following features:
 Blessed Healer. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the 
spell’s level.
 Disciple of Life. When you cast a 
spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains 
additional hit points equal to 2 + the 
spell’s level. Divine Strike. Once on each of your 
turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack 
to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage 
to the target.
Spellcasting. Drawing on the divine 
essence of nature, you can cast spells to 
shape that essence to your will.
 Cantrips. You know five cantrips, which 
you can cast at will. Preparing and Casting Spells. To cast 
one of your cleric spells, you must expend 
a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You 
regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You prepare the list of cleric spells that 
are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose up to fourteen cleric spells. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
 You can  change your list of prepared 
spells when you finish a long rest. When 
you prepare new spells, you must pray for 1 minute per spell level for each spell 
on your list.
 Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your 
spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion to the dwarven deities, 
especially Moradin. You use your 
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Ritual Casting. You can cast a cleric 
spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. Spellcasting Focus. You can use a holy 
symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

==================================================

--- Chunk 267 ---
Content: Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is 
in direct sunlight.
Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Trance. Instead of sleeping, you meditate 
deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day, gaining the same benefit that 
a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
Drow Magic. You know the dancing lights  
cantrip, and you can cast the darkness  
and the faerie fire spell once per day (save 
DC 15). Charisma is your spellcasting 
ability for these spells.
Rogue Features
Evasion. When you are subjected to an 
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, 
you instead take no damage if you 
succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.Drow Rogue 9
“I am in the business of removing obstacles.”
Without divine or arcane magical 
ability, your options in the 
cutthroat world of drow society were 
limited. You either became an expert in death, or you died young. After honing your murderous arts in 
the Underdark, you made your escape from the city of your birth to strike out on your own. Your reputation as a nigh-invisible killer strikes fear into those who would wrong you. But those who respect 
you earn your ready support.
Background (Charlatan)
You know what makes people tick, you can tease out their heart’s desires after a 
few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children’s books. Your favorite scheme is putting on new 
identities. Your facility with disguise makes it easy to insinuate yourself into any setting, the better to get your target alone.
 False Identity. You have created 
a second identity that includes 
documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, 
you can forge documents including 
official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you 
are trying to copy.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an organization of well-trained mercenaries, savvy rogues, and crafty warlocks who seek to expand their 
influence and power.
 Personality Trait. You lie about 
almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to. Ideal. You are a free spirit—no one tells 
you what to do.
 Bond. You owe everything to your 
mentor—a master drow assassin who sees your defection as a personal affront. Flaw.  You’re convinced that no 
one could ever fool you the way you fool others.
Drow Traits
Superior Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Sunlight Sensitivity. You have 
disadvantage on attack rolls and on Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 4d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the 
attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
Expertise. Your proficiency bonus is 
doubled for any ability check you make using your Deception, Perception, or 
Stealth skills.
Assassinate.  You have advantage on 
attack rolls against any creature that 
hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a 
creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that 
you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s 
damage against you.

Content: Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on 
sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is 
in direct sunlight.
Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Trance. Instead of sleeping, you meditate 
deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day, gaining the same benefit that 
a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
Drow Magic. You know the dancing lights  
cantrip, and you can cast the darkness  
and the faerie fire spell once per day (save 
DC 15). Charisma is your spellcasting 
ability for these spells.
Rogue Features
Evasion. When you are subjected to an 
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, 
you instead take no damage if you 
succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.Drow Rogue 8
“I am in the business of removing obstacles.”
Without divine or arcane magical 
ability, your options in the 
cutthroat world of drow society were 
limited. You either became an expert in death, or you died young. After honing your murderous arts in 
the Underdark, you made your escape from the city of your birth to strike out on your own. Your reputation as a nigh-invisible killer strikes fear into those who would wrong you. But those who respect 
you earn your ready support.
Background (Charlatan)
You know what makes people tick, you can tease out their heart’s desires after a 
few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children’s books. Your favorite scheme is putting on new 
identities. Your facility with disguise makes it easy to insinuate yourself into any setting, the better to get your target alone.
 False Identity. You have created 
a second identity that includes 
documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, 
you can forge documents including 
official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you 
are trying to copy.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Zhentarim, an organization of well-trained mercenaries, savvy rogues, and crafty warlocks who seek to expand their 
influence and power.
 Personality Trait. You lie about 
almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to. Ideal. You are a free spirit—no one tells 
you what to do.
 Bond. You owe everything to your 
mentor—a master drow assassin who sees your defection as a personal affront. Flaw.  You’re convinced that no 
one could ever fool you the way you fool others.
Drow Traits
Superior Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Sunlight Sensitivity. You have 
disadvantage on attack rolls and on Sneak Attack.  Once per turn, you 
can deal an extra 4d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the 
attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
Expertise. Your proficiency bonus is 
doubled for any ability check you make using your Deception, Perception, or 
Stealth skills.
Assassinate.  You have advantage on 
attack rolls against any creature that 
hasn’t taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a 
creature that is surprised is a critical hit.
Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that 
you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s 
damage against you.

Favored Enemy. You have significant 
experience studying, tracking, hunting, 
and even talking to dragons and 
giants. You have advantage on Wisdom 
(Survival) checks to track dragons or 
giants, as well as on Intelligence checks 
to recall information about them.
Natural Explorer. You are particularly 
at home in forest or Underdark terrain. 
When you make an Intelligence or 
Wisdom check related to forest or 
Underdark terrain, your proficiency 
bonus is doubled if you are using a skill 
that you’re proficient in.
 While traveling for an hour or more in 
forest or Underdark terrain, you gain the 
following benefits:
• Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your 
group’s speed.
• Your group can’t become lost except by 
magical means.
• Even when you are engaged in another 
activity while traveling, you remain 
alert to danger.
• If you are traveling alone, you can move 
stealthily at a normal pace.
• When you forage, you find twice as 
much food as you normally would.Elf Ranger 9
“Once I choose my prey, I never 
lose the trail or miss my mark. 
The hunt is all.”
The last remaining member of 
your tribe, you are the epitome 
of the rugged individualist. You know 
better than to ascribe qualities such as 
mercy or bounty to the forests of your 
youth. There are a thousand ways to die 
in the wilderness, and you have survived 
through muscle, wits, and will.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, far from 
civilization and the comforts of town and 
technology. The wilds are in your blood. 
Even in places where you don’t know the 
specific features of the terrain, you know 
the way of the wild.
 Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Emerald Enclave, a group dedicated to 
maintaining the delicate balance between 
nature and civilization.
 Personality Trait. I once ran twenty-
five miles without stopping to warn my 
clan of an approaching orc horde. I’d do it 
again if I had to.
 Ideal. Life is like the seasons, 
in constant change, and we must 
change with it.
 Bond.  I am the last of my tribe, and 
it is up to me to ensure their names 
enter legend.
 Flaw.  There’s no room for caution in a 
life lived to the fullest.
Wood Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright 
light, and in darkness as if it were dim 
light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Mask of the Wild. You can attempt 
to hide even when you are only lightly 
obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling 
snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.• While tracking other creatures, you 
also learn their exact number, their 
sizes, and how long ago they passed 
through the area.
Fighting Style: Archery. You gain a 
+2 bonus to attack rolls you make with 
ranged weapons. (This is factored into 
the stat block.)
Spellcasting. You have the ability to cast 
spells. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability 
for your ranger spells. You use your 
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your 
spellcasting ability.
 To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain 
all expended spell slots when you finish 
a long rest.

Content: Savage Attacks. When you score a 
critical hit with a melee weapon attack, 
you can roll one of the weapon’s damage 
dice one additional time and add it to the 
extra damage of the critical hit.
Paladin Features
Aura of Courage. You and friendly 
creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be 
frightened while you are conscious.
Aura of Protection. Whenever you or 
a friendly creature within 10 feet of you 
must make a saving throw, the creature 
gains a +4 bonus to the saving throw. You 
must be conscious to grant this bonus.
Divine Sense (4; Recharges after a 
Long Rest).  As an action, you can open 
your awareness to sense strong evil and 
powerful good. Until the end of your 
next turn, you know the location of any 
celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 
feet of you that is not behind total cover. 
You know the type of any being whose 
presence you sense, but not its identity. Half-Orc 
Paladin 10
“I might not be lovely to look 
upon, but glory blazes in my 
eyes and in my blade.”
Fury and resentment lie always just 
below the surface of your gleaming 
armor. For each wrong done you, you 
have sworn vengeance against those who 
would bring misery to the helpless.
 You are used to traveling on your own, 
meting out punishment on your terms 
wherever you find injustice. But recently 
you discovered others much like yourself, 
wanderers who fight monsters and defeat 
evildoers. True, they seem to be in it 
mostly for the money, but you welcome 
the companionship—for however 
long it lasts.
Background (Outlander)
You are an exile, unwelcome in both 
civilized society and the savage tribes of 
your parentage. Born after an orc raid, 
you were abandoned at a nearby temple 
and raised by the acolytes within. Despite 
the peaceful nature of their worship, your 
innate anger and resentment led you to 
the path of the war god.
 Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, an organization 
dedicated to smiting evil wherever it lurks 
and without hesitation.
 Personality Trait. You feel far more 
comfortable around animals than people.
 Ideal. You are driven to earn 
glory in battle.
 Bond.  You have sworn to bring terrible 
wrath down on evildoers.
 Flaw.  Violence is your answer to almost 
any challenge.
Half-Orc Traits
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it 
were dim light.
Relentless Endurance (Recharges after 
a Long Rest). When you are reduced to 0 
hit points but not killed outright, you can 
drop to 1 hit point instead.Within the same radius, you also detect 
the presence of any place or object that 
has been consecrated or desecrated, as 
with the hallow  spell.
Channel Divinity (Recharges after a 
Short or Long Rest). You can use one of 
the following options.
 Abjure Enemy. As an action, you 
present your holy symbol and speak 
a prayer of denunciation. Choose one 
creature within 60 feet of you that you 
can see. That creature must make a 
DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, unless it 
is immune to being frightened. Fiends 
and undead have disadvantage on this 
saving throw. 
 On a failed save, the creature is 
frightened for 1 minute or until it takes 
any damage. While frightened, the 
creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit 
from any bonus to its speed.
 On a successful save, the creature’s 
speed is halved for 1 minute or until the 
creature takes any damage.Character Name

“I apologize for cutting off your fascinating diatribe with my blade in your belly. Small talk was 
never my strong suit.”
You have spent decades studying the 
art of combat, refining your skills with relentless vigor. Cunning and patient, your mind plays out each attack and 
counter before you strike for maximum 
effect. Though your magical repertoire is extremely limited, the spells you have chosen enhance your already prodigious ability.
Background (Sage)
You are a serious student of all forms of combat. Despite your studious nature, 
you are aware that there are limits to 
practice and simulation. It is time to conduct some real-world application of your deadly art. Adventuring companions 
are usually the type who will need 
a steady hand and quick wits to bail them out, often. Thankfully, you have both to spare.
 Researcher. If you do not know a piece 
of information, you usually know where 
and from whom that knowledge can be obtained. Faction. You are a member of the 
Lord’s Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Personality Trait. You use polysyllabic 
words that convey the impression of great erudition. Ideal. The path to power and self-
improvement is through knowledge. Bond. Your life’s work is the Tome 
of Battle , a treatise related to your 
theories on combat.
 Flaw.  You speak without really 
thinking through your words, invariably 
insulting others.
High Elf Traits
Fey Ancestry.  You have advantage on 
saving throws against being charmed, 
and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Darkvision. You can see in dim light 
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, 
only shades of gray.
Trance. You don’t require sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does 
from 8 hours of sleep.You use your Intelligence whenever a 
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot 
of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. You may only learn spells of the 
abjuration and evocation schools.

“Do you hear that? It is the 
roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.

to a tribe. As long as they can prove 
themselves worthy of your company, you 
will travel with them.

Content: Ki (Recharges after You Finish a Short 
or Long Rest). You have 10 ki points, 
which you can spend on ki features (listed 
under this feature). You must spend at 
least 30 minutes of a rest meditating to 
regain them.
	 Deflect	Missiles.	 When you are hit by a 
ranged weapon attack, you can use your 
reaction to reduce the damage you take 
from the attack by 1d10 + 14.
 If you reduce the damage to 0, you can 
catch the missile if it is small enough for 
you to hold in one hand and you have at 
least one hand free. If you catch a missile 
in this way, you can spend 1 ki point 
to make a ranged attack with what you 
caught, as part of the same reaction. You

the missile counts as a monk weapon 
for the attack.

you take the Attack action on your turn, 
you can spend 1 ki point to make two 
unarmed strikes as a bonus action.Halfling 
Monk 10
“Size	of	the	body	indicates	
nothing	of	the	depth	of	the	spirit.”
Ascetic life tempered your endurance, 
and a doctrine of and helping others 
tempered your tolerance and compassion. 
Your kindness and understanding you 
give freely, but your beliefs reserve your 
wrath and martial arts expertise for the 
cruel and wicked, especially those who 
harm the innocent or weak. You wander 
the world as a righter of wrongs, and an 
example that the spirit transcends and 
conquers the material.
Background (Acolyte)
You spent your formative years in a 
monastery dedicated to the Triad—Torm, 
Tyr, and primarily for your order, Ilmater, 
god of endurance and martyrdom. As 
a priest, you can perform sacred rites, 
including counseling and aiding others.
 Shelter of the Faithful. You and your 
companions can receive aid at any site 
dedicated to the Triad or its member 
deities, especially Ilmater. You must 
provide any material components for 
spells cast on your behalf. Those who 
share your religion support you at a 
modest lifestyle.
 Faction. You are a member of the 
Order of the Gauntlet, seekers of justice 
who protect others from evildoers.
 Personality Trait. You can find 
common ground between the fiercest 
enemies, empathizing with them and 
always working toward peace.
 Ideal. You always try to help those in 
need, no matter what the personal cost.
 Bond.  Everything you do is to protect 
the common folk.
 Flaw.  You place too much trust in those 
who profess to share your faith.
Halfling Traits
Halfling Nimbleness.  You can move 
through the space of any creature that is 
of a size larger than yours.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on an attack 
roll, ability check, or saving throw, you 
can reroll the die and use the new roll.
Monk Features
Evasion. When you are subjected to an 
effect that allows you to make a Dexterity 
saving throw to take only half damage, 
you instead take no damage if you 
succeed on the saving throw, and only 
half damage if you fail. Whenever you hit a creature with one of 
these attacks, you can impose one of the 
following three effects on that target:
• It must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity 
saving throw or be knocked prone.
• It must succeed on a DC 14 Strength 
saving throw, or you can push it up to 
15 feet away from you.
• It can’t take reactions until the end of 
your next turn.
	 Patient	Defense.  You can spend 1 
ki point to take the Dodge action as a 
bonus action.
	 Step	of	the	Wind.	 You can spend 
1 ki point to take the Disengage or 
Dash action as a bonus action. If you 
do so, your jump distance is doubled 
for the turn.
	 Stunning	Strike.	 When you hit another 
creature with a melee weapon attack, 
you can spend 1 ki point. If you do so, 
the target must succeed on a DC 14 
Constitution saving throw or be stunned 
until the end of your next turn.Character Name

Sorcerer 8
“Do you hear that? It is the 
roaring in my blood.”
You are a ferocious wanderer of the 
untrodden ways, a survivor who 
constantly tests yourself against the 
dangers of the wild—and conquers.
 Despite your self-sufficiency, you 
tire of a life alone. Your clan is far, but 
these companions are the closest thing 
to a tribe. As long as they can prove 
themselves worthy of your company, you 
will travel with them.
Background (Outlander)
You grew up in the wilds, a fiercely 
proud member of a noble clan. The clan 
outweighs everything else in your life, 
even the stated law of the land.
  Wanderer. You have an excellent 
memory for maps and geography, and you 
can always recall the general layout of 
terrain, settlements, and other features 
around you. In addition, you can find food 
and fresh water for yourself and up to five 
other people each day, provided that the 
land offers berries, small game, water, 
and so forth.
 Faction. You are a member of 
the Emerald Enclave, defenders of 
the wild lands.
 Personality Trait. You once ran 
25 miles to warn your clan of an 
approaching threat, and you’d do 
the same again.
 Ideal. To dishonor yourself is to 
dishonor the clan.
 Bond.  Your clan is the most important 
thing in your life, even when they are 
far from you.
 Flaw.  It is nature’s way that the strong 
survive and the weak perish.

a cold breath weapon and resistance to 
cold damage.

ExcEptions  supErsEdE GEnEral rulEs
General rules govern each part of the game. For 
example, the combat rules tell you that melee at -
tacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity. 
That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as 
long as something in the game doesn’t explicitly say 
otherwise.
 The game also includes elements—class features, 
feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, mon -
ster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contra -
dict a general rule. When an exception and a general 
rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a 
feature says you can make melee attacks using your 
Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement 
disagrees with the general rule.
round  down
Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the 
game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even 
if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make 
an exception and tell you to round up.Playing the Game
Rhythm of Play
The three main pillars of D&D play are social in -
teraction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one 
you’re experiencing, the game unfolds according to 
this basic pattern:
1: The Game Master Describes a Scene. The GM 
tells the players where their adventurers are and 
what’s around them (how many doors lead out of 
a room, what’s on a table, and so on).
2: The Players Describe What Their Characters 
Do. Typically, the characters stick together as 
they travel through a dungeon or another envi -
ronment. Sometimes different adventurers do 
different things: one adventurer might search a 
treasure chest while a second examines a mys -
terious symbol engraved on a wall and a third 
keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the 
GM ensures that every character has a chance to 
act and decides how to

a room, what’s on a table, and so on).

treasure chest while a second examines a mys -

keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the 
GM ensures that every character has a chance to 
act and decides how to resolve their activity. In 
combat, the characters take turns.
3: The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventur -
ers’ Actions. Sometimes resolving a task is easy. 
If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to 
open a door, the GM might say the door opens and 
describe what lies beyond. But the door might be 
locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other 
circumstance might make it challenging for an 
adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the 
GM might ask the player to roll a die to help de -
termine what happens. Describing the results of -
ten leads to another decision point, which brings 
the game back to step 1.
This pattern holds during every game session 
(each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin, 
or fighting a dragon. In certain situations—partic -
ularly combat—the action is more structured, and 
everyone takes turns.
The Six Abilities
All creatures—characters and monsters—have six 
abilities that measure physical and mental charac -
teristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table.
Ability Descriptions
Ability Score Measures …
Strength Physical might
Dexterity Agility, reflexes, and balance
Constitution Health and stamina
Intelligence Reasoning and memory
Wisdom Perceptiveness and mental fortitude
Charisma Confidence, poise, and charm
Ability Scores
Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some 
monsters have a score as high as 30. The score 
represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability 
Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.
Ability Scores
Score Meaning
1 This is the lowest a score can normally go. 
If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect 
explains what happens.
2–9 This represents a weak capability.
10 –11 This represents the human average.
12–19 This represents a strong capability.
20 This is the highest an adventurer’s score can 
go unless a feature says otherwise. 
21–29 This represents an extraordinary capability.
30 This is the highest a score can go.
Ability Modifiers
Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever 
you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in 
“D20 Tests”). An ability modifier is derived from its 
score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.System Reference Document 5.2.16Ability Modifiers

D20 Tests
When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the 
game uses a d20 roll to determine success or fail -
ure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come 
in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and 
attack rolls. They follow these steps:
4: Roll 1d20.  You always want to roll high. If the 
roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described 
later in “Playing the Game”), you roll two d20s, 
but you use the number from only one of them—
the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower 
one if you have Disadvantage.
5: Add Modifiers. Add these modifiers to the num -
ber rolled on the d20:
• The Relevant Ability Modifier. “Playing the 
Game” and “Rules Glossary” explain which ability 
modifiers to use for various D20 Tests.
• Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant. Each crea-
ture has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added 
when making a D20 Test that uses something, 
such as a skill, in which the creature has pro -
ficiency. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the 
Game.”
• Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties. A class 
feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus 
or penalty to the die roll.
6: Compare the Total to a Target Number. If the 
total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or ex -
ceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds. 
Otherwise, it fails. The Game Master determines 
target numbers and tells players whether their 
rolls are successful. The target number for an 
ability check or a saving throw is called a Diffi -
culty Class (DC). The target number for an attack 
roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which appears 
on a character sheet or in a stat block (see “Rules 
Glossary”).Ability Checks
An ability check represents a creature using talent 
and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as 
forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertain -
ing a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the 
rules often call for an ability check when a creature 
attempts something other than an attack that has a 
chance of

Content: an 
ability check or a saving throw is called a Diffi -
culty Class (DC). The target number for an attack 
roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which appears 
on a character sheet or in a stat block (see “Rules 
Glossary”).Ability Checks
An ability check represents a creature using talent 
and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as 
forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertain -
ing a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the 
rules often call for an ability check when a creature 
attempts something other than an attack that has a 
chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is 
uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice de -
termine the result.
Ability Modifier
An ability check is named for the ability modifier it 
uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so 
on. Different ability checks are called for in differ -
ent situations, depending on which ability is most 
relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for 
examples of each check’s use.
Ability Check Examples
Ability Make a Check To …
Strength Lift, push, pull, or break something
Dexterity Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly
Constitution Push your body beyond normal limits
Intelligence Reason or remember
Wisdom Notice things in the environment or in 
creatures’ behavior
Charisma Influence, entertain, or deceive
Proficiency Bonus
Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check 
when the GM determines that a skill or tool pro -
ficiency is relevant to the check and you have 
that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a 
Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can 
add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have 
proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See 
“Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for more 
information about skill and tool proficiencies.
Difficulty Class
The Difficulty Class of an ability check represents 
the task’s difficulty. The more difficult the task, 
the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain 
checks, but the GM ultimately sets them. The Typi -
cal Difficulty Classes table presents a range of pos -
sible DCs for ability checks.
Typical Difficulty Classes
Task Difficulty DC
Very easy 5
Easy 10
Medium 15
Hard 20Task Difficulty DC
Very hard 25
Nearly impossible 30System Reference Document 5.2.17Saving Throws
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an 
attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery 
explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying 
to invade your mind. You don’t normally choose to 
make a save; you must make one because your char -
acter or a monster (if you’re the GM) is at risk. A 
save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it.
 If you don’t want to resist the effect, you can 
choose to fail the save without rolling.
Ability Modifier
Saving throws are named for the ability modifiers 
they use: a Constitution saving throw, a Wisdom 
saving throw, and so on. Different saving throws are 
used to resist different kinds of effects, as shown on 
the Saving Throw Examples table.
Saving Throw Examples
Ability Make a Save To …
Strength Physically resist direct force
Dexterity Dodge out of harm’s way
Constitution Endure a toxic hazard
Intelligence Recognize an illusion as fake
Wisdom Resist a mental assault
Charisma Assert your identity
Proficiency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your saving 
throw if you have proficiency in that kind of save. 
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game.”
Difficulty Class
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is deter -
mined by the effect that causes it or by the GM. For 
example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC 
is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability 
and Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call 
for saves specify the DC.
Attack Rolls
An attack roll determines whether an attack hits 
a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or 
exceeds the target’s Armor Class. Attack rolls usu -
ally occur in battle, described in “Combat” later in 
“Playing the Game,” but the GM might also ask for 
an attack roll in other situations, such as an archery 
competition.
Ability Modifier
The Attack Roll Abilities table shows which ability 
modifier to use for different types of attack rolls.Attack Roll Abilities
Ability Attack Type
Strength Melee attack with a weapon or an Un -
armed Strike (see “Rules Glossary”)
Dexterity Ranged attack with a weapon
Varies Spell attack (the ability used is determined 
by the spellcaster’s spellcasting feature, as 
explained in “Spells”)
Some features let you use different ability modifiers 
from those listed. For example, the Finesse property 
(see “Equipment”) lets you use Strength or Dexter -
ity with a weapon that has that property.
Proficiency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll 
when you attack using a weapon you have profi -
ciency with, as well as when you attack with a spell. 
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for 
more information about weapon proficiencies.
Armor Class
A creature’s Armor Class represents how well the 
creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC 
of a character is determined at character creation 
(see “Character Creation”), whereas the AC of a

--- Chunk 291 ---
Content: ability modifiers 
from those listed. For example, the Finesse property 
(see “Equipment”) lets you use Strength or Dexter -
ity with a weapon that has that property.
Proficiency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll 
when you attack using a weapon you have profi -
ciency with, as well as when you attack with a spell. 
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for 
more information about weapon proficiencies.
Armor Class
A creature’s Armor Class represents how well the 
creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC 
of a character is determined at character creation 
(see “Character Creation”), whereas the AC of a 
monster appears in its stat block.
 Calculating AC. All creatures start with the same 
base AC calculation:
Base AC  = 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modifier
A creature’s AC can then be modified by armor, 
magic items, spells, and more.
 Only One Base AC. Some spells and class features 
give characters a different way to calculate their AC. 
A character with multiple features that give differ -
ent ways to calculate AC must choose which one to 
use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a 
creature.
Rolling 20 or 1
If you roll a 20 on the d20 (called a “natural 20”) for 
an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any mod -
ifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a Critical Hit 
(see “Combat” later in “Playing the Game”).
 If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”) for an at -
tack roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifi -
ers or the target’s AC.
Advantage/Disadvantage
Sometimes a D20 Test is modified by Advantage or 
Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive cir -
cumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvan -
tage reflects negative circumstances.
 You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage 
through the use of special abilities and actions. The System Reference Document 5.2.18
HEroic inspiration
Sometimes the GM or a rule gives you Heroic Inspira -
tion. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it 
to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you 
must use the new roll.
 Only One at a Time. You can never have more 
than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something 
gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it, 
you can give it to a player character in your group 
who lacks it.
 Gaining Heroic Inspiration.  Your GM can 
give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons. 
Typically, GMs award it when you do something par -
ticularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It’s a 
reward for making the game more fun for everyone 
playing.
 Other rules might allow your character to gain 
Heroic Inspiration independent of the GM’s decision. 
For example, Human characters start each day with 
Heroic Inspiration.
GM can also decide that circumstances grant Ad -
vantage or impose Disadvantage.
Roll Two D20s
When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage, 
roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the 
higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and 
use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For ex -
ample, if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a 
3, use the 3. If you instead have Advantage and roll 
those numbers, use the 18.
They Don’t Stack
If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant 
Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Simi -
larly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on 
a roll, you roll only two d20s.
 If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advan -
tage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them, 
and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple 
circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one 
grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, 
you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage.
Interactions with Rerolls
When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and 
something in the game lets you reroll or replace the 
d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not both. 
You choose which one.
 For example, if you have Heroic Inspiration (see 
the sidebar below) and roll a 3 and an 18 on an abil -
ity check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you 
could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one 
of those dice, not both of them.Proficiency
Characters and monsters are good at various 
things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while 
others can use only a few. Some are better at under -
standing people’s motives, and others are better at 
unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All crea-
tures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the 
impact that training has on the creature’s capabil -
ities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as 
the character gains levels (described in “Character 
Creation”). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based 
on its Challenge Rating (see “Rules Glossary”). The 
Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is 
determined.
 This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the crea-
ture has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw,

 This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the crea-
ture has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or 
with an item that the creature uses to make the D20 
Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for 
calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.

The Bonus Doesn’t Stack
Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll 
or another number more than once. For example, if 
a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or 
Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus 
if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t add 
it twice if you’re proficient in both skills.
 Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be mul -
tiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) 
before being added. For example, the Expertise 
feature (see “Rules Glossary”) doubles the Profi -
ciency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever 
the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and 
divided only once.
Skill Proficiencies
Most ability checks involve using a skill, which rep -
resents a category of things creatures try to do with 
an ability check. The descriptions of the actions 
you take (see “Actions” later in “Playing the Game”) 
specify which skill applies if you make an ability 
check for that action, and many other rules note 
when a skill is relevant. The GM has the ultimate say 
on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.
 If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature 
applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks in -
volving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a 
creature can still make ability checks involving System Reference Document 5.2.19that skill but doesn’t add its Proficiency Bonus. For 
example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the GM 
might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the 
character has Athletics proficiency, the character 
adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check. 
If the character lacks that proficiency, they make 
the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.
Skill List
The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes 
example uses for each skill proficiency as well as 
the ability check the skill most often applies to.
Determining Skills
A character’s starting skill proficiencies are deter -
mined at character creation, and a monster’s skill 
proficiencies appear in its stat block.
Saving Throw Proficiencies
Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add 
their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a partic -
ular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom 
saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your 
Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving 
throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.
 Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving 
throws, representing that class’s training in evading 
or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example, 
are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves; 
they train to resist mental assault.Equipment Proficiencies
A character gains proficiency with various weapons 
and tools from their class and background. There 
are two categories of equipment proficiency:
Weapons.  Anyone can wield a weapon, but profi -
ciency makes you better at wielding it. If you have 
proficiency with a weapon, you add your Profi -
ciency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.
Tools.  If you have proficiency with a tool, you can 
add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check 
you make that uses the tool. If you have profi -
ciency in the skill that’s also used with that check, 
you have Advantage on the check too. This means 
you can benefit from both skill proficiency and 
tool proficiency on the same ability check.
Actions
When you do something other than moving or com-
municating, you typically take an action. The Action 
table lists the game’s main actions, which are de -
fined in more detail in “Rules Glossary.”

Player characters and monsters can also do things 
not covered by these actions. Many class features 
and other abilities provide additional action op -
tions, and you can improvise other actions. When 
you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the 
rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action 
is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to 
make, if any.
One Thing at a Time
The game uses actions to govern how much you can 
do at one time. You can take only one action at a 
time. This principle is most important in combat, as 
explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”
 Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a 
social interaction, you can try to Influence a crea-
ture or use the Search action to read the creature’s 
body language, but you can’t do both at the same 
time. And when you’re exploring a dungeon, you 
can’t simultaneously use the Search action to look 
for traps and use the Help action to aid another 
character who’s trying to open a stuck door (with 
the Utilize action).
Bonus Actions
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let 
you take an additional action on your turn called 
a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You 
can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability, 
a spell, or another feature of the game states that 
you can do something as a Bonus Action. You other -
wise don’t have a Bonus Action to take.
 You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn, 
so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if you 
have more than one available.
 You choose when to take a Bonus Action during 
your turn unless the Bonus Action’s timing is spec -
ified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to 
take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus 
Action.
Reactions
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations al -
low you to take a special action called a Reaction. A 
Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some 
kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone 
else’s. The Opportunity Attack, described later in 
“Playing the Game,” is the most common type of 
Reaction.
 When you take a Reaction, you can’t take another 
one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction 
interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature 
can continue its turn right after the Reaction.
 In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immedi -
ately after its trigger unless the Reaction’s descrip -
tion says otherwise.

Content: called a Reaction. A 
Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some 
kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone 
else’s. The Opportunity Attack, described later in 
“Playing the Game,” is the most common type of 
Reaction.
 When you take a Reaction, you can’t take another 
one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction 
interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature 
can continue its turn right after the Reaction.
 In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immedi -
ately after its trigger unless the Reaction’s descrip -
tion says otherwise.
Social Interaction
During their adventures, player characters meet 
many different people and face some monsters that 
would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it’s 
time for social interaction, which takes many forms. 
For example, you might try to convince a burglar to 
confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The 
Game Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer 
characters who are participating.
 An NPC’s attitude toward your character is 
Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined in “Rules 
Glossary.” Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help, 
and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.
 Social interactions progress in two ways: through 
roleplaying and ability checks.
Roleplaying
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. 
In this case, it’s you as a player determining how 
your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is 
part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the 
fore during social interactions.
 As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an 
active approach or a descriptive approach.
 The GM uses an NPC’s personality and your char -
acter’s actions and attitudes to determine how an System Reference Document 5.2.111NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under 
threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant 
refuses to help if the characters badger her. A vain 
dragon laps up flattery.
 When interacting with an NPC, pay attention to 
the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s personality. You 
might be able to learn an NPC’s goals and then use 
that information to influence the NPC.
 If you offer NPCs something they want or play 
on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can form 
friendships, ward off violence, or learn a key piece 
of information. On the other hand, if you insult a 
proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your 
efforts to convince or deceive will likely fail.
Ability Checks
Ability checks can be key in determining the out -
come of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts 
can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be 
an element of chance if the GM wants dice to play 
a role in determining an NPC’s response to you. In 
such situations, the GM will typically ask you to 
take the Influence action.
 Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when 
thinking of how you will interact with an NPC; use 
an approach that relies on your group’s skill pro -
ficiencies. For example, if the group needs to trick 
a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue 
who is proficient in Deception should lead the 
discussion.
Exploration
Exploration involves delving into places that are 
dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this sec -
tion detail some of the ways adventurers interact 
with the environment in such places.
Adventuring Equipment
As adventurers explore, their equipment can help 
them in many ways. For example, they can reach 
out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things 
they wouldn’t otherwise notice with a Torch or 
another light source, bypass locked doors and con -
tainers with Thieves’ Tools, and create obstacles for 
pursuers with Caltrops.
 See “Equipment” for rules on many items that are 
useful on adventures. The items in the“Tools” and 
“Adventuring Gear” sections are especially useful. 
The weapons in “Equipment” can also be used for 
more than battle; you could use a Quarterstaff, 
for example, to push a sinister-looking button that 
you’re reluctant to touch.Vision and Light
Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger, 
hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are 
affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can 
hinder you, as explained below.
Obscured Areas
An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a 
Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim 
Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have 
Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that 
rely on sight.
 A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with 
Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque. 
You have the Blinded condition (see “Rules Glos -
sary”) when trying to see something there.
Light
The presence or absence of light determines the cat -
egory of illumination in an area, as defined below.
 Bright Light.  Bright Light lets most creatures see 
normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as 
do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illu -
mination within a specific radius.
 Dim Light. Dim Light, also called shadows, cre -
ates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light 
is usually a boundary

Content: A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with 
Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque. 
You have the Blinded condition (see “Rules Glos -
sary”) when trying to see something there.
Light
The presence or absence of light determines the cat -
egory of illumination in an area, as defined below.
 Bright Light.  Bright Light lets most creatures see 
normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as 
do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illu -
mination within a specific radius.
 Dim Light. Dim Light, also called shadows, cre -
ates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light 
is usually a boundary between Bright Light and 
surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and 
dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might 
bathe the land in Dim Light.
 Darkness.  Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured 
area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night 
(even most moonlit nights), within the confines of 
an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.
Special Senses
Some creatures have special senses that help them 
perceive things in certain situations. “Rules Glos -
sary” defines the following special senses:
Blindsight
Darkvision
Tremorsense
Truesight
Hiding
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to 
spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an 
ambush. The Game Master decides when circum -
stances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to 
hide, you take the Hide action.
Interacting with Objects
Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve. 
The player tells the GM that their character is do -
ing something, such as moving a lever or opening System Reference Document 5.2.112
Marc HinG ordEr
The adventurers should establish a marching order 
while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A 
marching order makes it easier to determine which 
characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot 
hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to 
those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change 
your marching order outside combat and record the 
order any way you like: write it down, for example, 
or arrange miniatures to show it.a door, and the GM describes what happens. Some -
times, however, rules govern what you can do with 
an object, as detailed in the following sections.
What Is an Object?
For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete, 
inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, 
table, chair, or stone. It isn’t a building or a vehicle, 
which are composed of many objects.
Time-Limited Object Interactions
When time is short, such as in combat, interactions 
with objects are limited: one free interaction per 
turn. That interaction must occur during a crea-
ture’s movement or action. Any additional inter -
actions require the Utilize action, as explained in 
“Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”
Finding Hidden Objects
When your character searches for hidden things, 
such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks 
you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided 
you describe the character searching in the hidden 
object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object, 
other important details, or both.
 If you describe your character searching nowhere 
near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check 
won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.
Carrying Objects
You can usually carry your gear and treasure with -
out worrying about the weight of those objects. If 
you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a mas -
sive number of lighter objects, the GM might require 
you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in 
“Rules Glossary.”
Breaking Objects
As an action, you can automatically break or oth -
erwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such 
as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to 
damage something more resilient, the GM might use 
the rules on breaking objects in “Rules Glossary.”Hazards
Monsters are the main perils characters face, but 
other dangers await. “Rules Glossary” defines the 
following hazards:
Burning
DehydrationFalling
MalnutritionSuffocation
Travel
During an adventure, the characters might travel 
long distances on trips that could take hours or 
days. The GM can summarize this travel without 
calculating exact distances or travel times, or the 
GM might have you use the travel pace rules below.
 If you need to know how fast you can move when 
every second matters, see the movement rules in 
“Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”
Travel Pace
While traveling outside combat, a group can move 
at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the 
Travel Pace table. The table states how far the 
party can move in a period of time; if riding horses 
or other mounts, the group can move twice that 
distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a 
Short or Long Rest before they can move at that in -
creased pace again (see “Equipment” for a selection 
of mounts for sale). “Gameplay Toolbox” has rules 
that affect which pace you can choose in certain 
types of terrain.

playin G on a Grid
If you play using a square grid and miniatures or 
other tokens, follow these rules.
 Squares.  Each square represents 5 feet.
 Speed.  Rather than moving foot by foot, move 
square by square on the grid, using your Speed in 
5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into 
squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of 
30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you use a grid of -
ten, consider writing your Speed in squares on your 
character sheet.
 Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must 
have enough movement left to pay for entering. It 
costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied 
square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally 
or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain 
costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a 
square cost even more.
 Corners.  Diagonal movement can’t cross the cor -
ner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature 
that fills its space.
 Ranges.  To determine the range on a grid be -
tween two things—whether creatures or objects—
count squares from a square adjacent to one of them 
and stop counting in the space of the other one. 
Count by the shortest route.Combat
Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters 
and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat 
often breaks out.
The Order of Combat
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two 
sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, 
footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes 
combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round 
represents about 6 seconds in the game world. 
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a 
turn. The order of turns is determined at the begin -
ning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once 
everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the 
next round if neither side is defeated.
Combat Step by Step
Combat unfolds in these steps:
1: Establish Positions.  The Game Master deter -
mines where all the characters and monsters are 
located. Given the adventurers’ marching order 
or their stated positions in the room or other lo -
cation, the GM figures out where the adversaries 
are—how far away and in what direction.
2: Roll Initiative.  Everyone involved in the combat 
encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order 
of combatants’ turns.
3: Take Turns.  Each participant in the battle takes 
a turn in Initiative order. When everyone in -
volved in the combat has had a turn, the round 
ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.
Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during 
combat. When combat starts, every participant 
rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that 
determines their place in the Initiative order. The 
GM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical crea-
tures, the GM makes a single roll, so each member of 
the group has the same Initiative.
 Surprise.  If a combatant is surprised by combat 
starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their 
Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts 
combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware 
that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.
 Initiative Order.  A combatant’s check total is 
called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short. 
The GM ranks the combatants, from highest to 
lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act 
during each round. The Initiative order remains the 
same from round to round.
 Ties. If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order 
among

Content: Initiative.
 Surprise.  If a combatant is surprised by combat 
starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their 
Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts 
combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware 
that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.
 Initiative Order.  A combatant’s check total is 
called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short. 
The GM ranks the combatants, from highest to 
lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act 
during each round. The Initiative order remains the 
same from round to round.
 Ties. If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order 
among tied monsters, and the players decide the 
order among tied characters. The GM decides the order if the tie is between a monster and a player 
character.
Your Turn
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your 
Speed and take one action. You decide whether to 
move first or take your action first.
 The main actions you can take are listed in “Ac -
tions” earlier in “Playing the Game.” A character’s 
features and a monster’s stat block also provide 
action options. “Movement and Position” later in 
“Playing the Game” gives the rules for movement.
 Communicating.  You can communicate however 
you are able—through brief utterances and ges -
tures—as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither 
your action nor your move.
 Extended communication, such as a detailed ex -
planation of something or an attempt to persuade a 
foe, requires an action. The Influence action is the 
main way you try to influence a monster.
 Interacting with Things. You can interact with 
one object or feature of the environment for free, 
during either your move or action. For example, you 
could open a door during your move as you stride 
toward a foe.
 If you want to interact with a second object, you 
need to take the Utilize action. Some magic items 
and other special objects always require an action 
to use, as stated in their descriptions.System Reference Document 5.2.114
unsEEn attack Ers and tarGEts
When you make an attack roll against a target you 
can’t see, you have Disadvantage on the roll. This is 
true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or 
targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the 
target isn’t in the location you targeted, you miss.
 When a creature can’t see you, you have Advantage 
on attack rolls against it.
 If you are hidden when you make an attack roll, 
you give away your location when the attack hits or 
misses. The GM might require you to use an action for 
any of these activities when it needs special care or 
when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, 
the GM might require you to take the Utilize action 
to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a 
drawbridge.
 Doing Nothing on Your Turn. You can forgo mov -
ing, taking an action, or doing anything at all on 
your turn. If you can’t decide what to do, consider 
taking the defensive Dodge action or the Ready ac -
tion to delay acting.
Ending Combat
Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated, 
which can mean the creatures are killed or knocked 
out or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also 
end when both sides agree to end it.
Movement and Position
On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your 
Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move.
 Your movement can include climbing, crawling, 
jumping, and swimming (each explained in “Rules 
Glossary”). These different modes of movement can 
be combined with your regular movement, or they 
can constitute your entire move.
 However you’re moving with your Speed, you 
deduct the distance of each part of your move from 
it until it is used up or until you are done moving, 
whichever comes first.
 A character’s Speed is determined during char -
acter creation. A monster’s Speed is noted in the 
monster’s stat block. See “Rules Glossary” for more 
about Speed as well as about special speeds, such as 
a Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed.
Difficult Terrain
Combatants are often slowed down by Difficult 
Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep 
stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Diffi -
cult Terrain.
 Every foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs 
1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count 
as Difficult Terrain.
Breaking Up Your Move
You can break up your move, using some of its 
movement before and after any action, Bonus Ac -
tion, or Reaction you take on the same turn. For 
example, if you have a Speed of 30 feet, you could go 
10 feet, take an action, and then go 20 feet.
Dropping Prone
On your turn, you can give yourself the Prone condi -
tion (see “Rules Glossary”) without using an action 
or any of your Speed, but you can’t do so

A creature belongs to a size category, which deter -
mines the width of the square space the creature 
occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size 
and Space table. That table lists the sizes from 
smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature’s 
space is the area that it effectively controls in com -
bat and the area it needs to fight effectively.
 A character’s size is determined by species, and 
a monster’s size is specified in the monster’s stat 
block.
Creature Size and Space
Size Space (Feet) Space (Squares)
Tiny 2½ by 2½ feet 4 per square
Small 5 by 5 feet 1 square
Medium 5 by 5 feet 1 square
Large 10 by 10 feet 4 squares (2 by 2)
Huge 15 by 15 feet 9 squares (3 by 3)
Gargantuan 20 by 20 feet 16 squares (4 by 4)
Moving around Other Creatures
During your move, you can pass through the space 
of an ally, a creature that has the Incapacitated 
condition (see “Rules Glossary”), a Tiny creature, or 
a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than 
you.
 Another creature’s space is Difficult Terrain for 
you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally.
 You can’t willingly end a move in a space occupied 
by another creature. If you somehow end a turn in 
a space with another creature, you have the Prone 
condition (see “Rules Glossary”) unless you are Tiny 
or are of a larger size than the other creature.
Making an Attack
When you take the Attack action, you make an 
attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and Re -
actions also let you make an attack. Whether you 
strike with a Melee weapon, fire a Ranged weapon, System Reference Document 5.2.115or make an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack 
has the following structure:
1: Choose a Target. Pick a target within your at -
tack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2: Determine Modifiers. The GM determines 
whether the target has Cover (see the next sec -
tion) and whether you have Advantage or Dis -
advantage against the target. In addition, spells, 
special abilities, and other effects can apply pen -
alties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3: Resolve the Attack.  Make the attack roll, as 
detailed earlier in “Playing the Game.” On a hit, 
you roll damage unless the particular attack 
has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks 
cause special effects in addition to or instead of 
damage.
Cover
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can pro -
vide cover, making a target more difficult to harm. 
As detailed in the Cover table, there are three de -
grees of cover, each of which gives a different bene -
fit to a target.
 A target can benefit from cover only when an at -
tack or other effect originates on the opposite side 
of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources 
of cover, only the most protective degree of cover 
applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For ex -
ample, if a target is behind a creature that gives Half 
Cover and a tree trunk that gives Three-Quarters 
Cover, the target has Three-Quarters Cover.

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow, 
hurl an axe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a 
foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a 
ranged attack.
Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets 
within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as 
one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t 
attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a 
Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is 
the normal range, and the larger number is the long 
range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your 
target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack 
a target beyond long range.
Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe 
is next to you. When you make

one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t 
attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a 
Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is 
the normal range, and the larger number is the long 
range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your 
target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack 
a target beyond long range.
Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe 
is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll 
with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you 
have Disadvantage on the roll if you are within 5 
feet of an enemy who can see you and doesn’t have 
the Incapacitated condition (see “Rules Glossary”).
Melee Attacks
A melee attack allows you to attack a target within 
your reach. A melee attack typically uses a hand -
held weapon or an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters 
make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or other body 
parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks.
Reach
A creature has a 5-foot reach and can thus attack 
targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack. 
Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach 
greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.
Opportunity Attacks
Combatants watch for enemies to drop their guard. 
If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put your -
self in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack.
 Avoiding Opportunity Attacks.  You can avoid 
provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the 
Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an Oppor -
tunity Attack when you Teleport or when you are 
moved without using your movement, action, Bonus 
Action, or Reaction. For example, you don’t provoke 
an Opportunity Attack if an explosion hurls you out 
of a foe’s reach or if you fall past an enemy.
 Making an Opportunity Attack. You can make an 
Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can 
see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Re -
action to make one melee attack with a weapon or 
an Unarmed Strike against that creature. The attack 
occurs right before it leaves your reach.
Mounted Combat
A willing creature that is at least one size larger 
than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy 
can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
Mounting and Dismounting
During your move, you can mount a creature that 
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs 
an amount of movement equal to half your Speed 
(round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet, 
you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.System Reference Document 5.2.116
rEstin G
Adventurers can’t spend every hour adventuring. 
They need rest. Any creature can take hour-long 
Short Rests in the midst of a day and an 8-hour Long 
Rest to end it. Regaining Hit Points is one of the main 
benefits of a rest. “Rules Glossary” provides the 
rules for Short and Long Rests.Controlling a Mount
You can control a mount only if it has been trained 
to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and 
similar creatures have such training.
 The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to 
match yours when you mount it. It moves on your 
turn as you direct it, and it has only three action op -
tions during that turn: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. 
A controlled mount can move and act even on the 
turn that you mount it.
 In contrast, an independent mount—one that lets 
you ride but ignores your control—retains its place 
in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.
Falling Off
If an effect is about to move your mount against its 
will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 
Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing with the 
Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) in an unoc -
cupied space within 5 feet of the mount.
 While mounted, you must make the same save if 
you’re knocked Prone or the mount is.
Underwater Combat
A fight underwater follows these rules.
Impeded Weapons
When making a melee attack roll with a weapon 
underwater, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed has 
Disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon 
deals Piercing damage.
 A ranged attack roll with a weapon underwater 
automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s 
normal range, and the attack roll has Disadvantage 
against a target within normal range.
Fire Resistance
Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire dam -
age (explained in “Damage and Healing”).
Damage and Healing
Injury and death are frequent threats, as detailed in 
the following rules.
Hit Points
Hit Points represent durability and the will to live. 
Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult 
to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current 
Hit Points can be any number from that maximum 
down

--- Chunk 300 ---
Content: A ranged attack roll with a weapon underwater 
automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s

against a target within normal range.
Fire Resistance
Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire dam -
age (explained in “Damage and Healing”).
Damage and Healing
Injury and death are frequent threats, as detailed in 
the following rules.
Hit Points
Hit Points represent durability and the will to live. 
Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult 
to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current 
Hit Points can be any number from that maximum 
down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go.
 Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your 
Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capa-
bilities until you reach 0 Hit Points.
 If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you’re 
Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but 
which might trigger other game effects.
Damage Rolls
Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability 
specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage 
dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to 
your target. If there’s a penalty to the damage, it’s 
possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage.
 When attacking with a weapon, you add your abil -
ity modifier—the same modifier used for the attack 
roll—to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice 
to roll for damage and whether to add any modi -
fiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don’t add 
your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that 
doesn’t use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun. 
See “Equipment” for weapons’ damage dice and 
“Spells” for spells’ damage dice.
Critical Hits
When you score a Critical Hit, you deal extra dam -
age. Roll the attack’s damage dice twice, add them 
together, and add any relevant modifiers as normal. 
For example, if you score a Critical Hit with a Dag -
ger, roll 2d4 for the damage rather than 1d4, and 
add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack in -
volves other damage dice, such as from the Rogue’s 
Sneak Attack feature, you also roll those dice twice.
Saving Throws and Damage
Damage dealt via saving throws uses these rules.
Damage against Multiple Targets
When you create a damaging effect that forces two 
or more targets to make saving throws against it at 
the same time, roll the damage once for all the tar -
gets. For example, when a wizard casts Fireball, the 
spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught 
in the blast.
Half Damage
Many saving throw effects deal half damage (round 
down) to a target when the target succeeds on the 
saving throw. The halved damage is equal to half 
the damage that would be dealt on a failed save.
Damage Types
Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire 
or Slashing. Damage types are listed in “Rules System Reference Document 5.2.117
knockin G out a crEatur E
When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points 
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the crea -
ture to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condi -
tion. It then starts a Short Rest, at the end of which 
that condition ends on it. The condition ends early 
if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone 
takes an action to administer first aid to it, making a 
successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.Glossary” and have no rules of their own, but other 
rules, such as Resistance, rely on damage types.
Resistance and Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects have Resistance or 
Vulnerability to certain damage types. If you have 
Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type 
is halved against you (round down). If you have 
Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type 
is doubled against you. For example, if you have 
Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved 
against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire 
damage, such damage is doubled against you.
No Stacking
Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability 
that affect the same damage type count as only one 
instance. For example, if you have Resistance to Ne -
crotic damage as well as Resistance to all damage, 
Necrotic damage is reduced by half against you.
Order of Application
Modifiers to damage are applied in the following 
order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or 
multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied 
second; and Vulnerability is applied third.
 For example, a creature has Resistance to all dam -
age and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it’s within 
a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. If it 
takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced 
by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature’s Resis -
tance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for 
its Vulnerability (to 22).

tain damage types and conditions. Immunity

Immunity
Some creatures and objects have Immunity to cer -
tain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a 
damage type means you don’t take damage of that 
type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren’t 
affected by it.
Healing
Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the 
Cure Wounds  spell or a Potion of Healing , or by a 
Short or Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”). When you receive healing, add the restored Hit 
Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points 
can’t exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit 
Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost. 
For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing 
and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of 
20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8.
Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies 
outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.
Instant Death
Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly.
 Monster Death.  A monster dies the instant it 
drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Game Master can 
ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat 
it like a character.
 Hit Point Maximum of 0. A creature dies if its Hit 
Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life 
energy, reducing a creature’s Hit Point maximum.
 Massive Damage.  When damage reduces a char -
acter to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the char -
acter dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their 
Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character 
has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit 
Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to 
0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character 
then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.
Character Demise
If your character dies, others might find a magical 
way to revive your character, such as with the Raise 
Dead  spell. Or talk with the GM about making a new 
character to join the group. “Rules Glossary” has 
more information on being dead.
Falling Unconscious
If you reach 0 Hit Points and don’t die instantly, you 
have the Unconscious condition (see “Rules Glos -
sary”) until you regain any Hit Points, and you now 
face making Death Saving Throws (see below).
Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points, 
you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine 
whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life. 
Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an 
ability score. You’re in the hands of fate now.
 Three Successes/Failures.  Roll 1d20. If the roll 
is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A 
success or failure has no effect by itself. On your 
third success, you become Stable (see “Stabilizing a 
Character” below). On your third failure, you die.
 The successes and failures don’t need to be con -
secutive; keep track of both until you collect three 
of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when 
you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.System Reference Document 5.2.118 Rolling a 1 or 20. When you roll a 1 on the d20 
for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If 
you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point.
 Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage 
while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Sav -
ing Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical 
Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage 
equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.
Stabilizing a Character
You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a 
creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a suc -
cessful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
 A Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving 
Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still 
has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes 
damage, it stops being Stable and starts making 
Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that 
isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.
Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit 
Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit 
Points, as explained below.
Lose Temporary Hit Points First
If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage, 
those points are lost first, and any leftover damage

isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.
Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit 
Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit 
Points, as explained below.
Lose Temporary Hit Points First
If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage, 
those points are lost first, and any leftover damage

have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage, 
you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.Duration
Temporary Hit Points last until they’re depleted or 
you finish a Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).
They Don’t Stack
Temporary Hit Points can’t be added together. If 
you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more 
of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you 
have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell 
grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you al -
ready have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.
They’re Not Hit Points or Healing
Temporary Hit Points can’t be added to your Hit 
Points, healing can’t restore them, and receiving 
Temporary Hit Points doesn’t count as healing. Be -
cause Temporary Hit Points aren’t Hit Points, a crea-
ture can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary 
Hit Points.
 If you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit 
Points doesn’t restore you to consciousness. Only 
true healing can save you.System Reference Document 5.2.119Character 
Creation
Choose a Character Sheet
You’ll record the main details of your character on 
a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use 
the term “character sheet” to mean whatever you 
use to track your character’s details, whether it’s a 
printed character sheet, a digital character sheet, or 
plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works 
for you, and then embark on creating a character!
Create Your Character
Here are the steps to make a character; each step is 
explored in detail:
1:  Choose a Class. Every adventurer is a member 
of a class. A class broadly describes a character’s 
vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.
2:  Determine Origin.  A character’s origin includes 
two elements: background and species. How did 
the character spend the years leading up to a life 
of adventure? Who are the character’s ancestors? 
You can also choose your character’s languages.
3: Determine Ability Scores.  Much of what your 
character does in the game depends on the char -
acter’s six abilities.
4:  Choose an Alignment.  Alignment is a shorthand 
for your character’s moral compass.
5: Fill in Details.  Using the choices you’ve made, fill 
in the remaining details on your character sheet.
Step 1: Choose Class
Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet. 
The Class Overview table summarizes the classes. 
See “Classes” for the classes’ details.

Write Your Level
Write your character’s level on your character 
sheet. Typically, a character starts at level 1 and 
advances in level by adventuring and gaining Expe -
rience Points (XP).
 Write Your XP.  Also record your Experience 
Points. A level 1 character has 0 XP. 
 Starting at a Higher Level. Your GM might start 
you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher, 
write your chosen subclass on your character sheet. 
See the “Starting at Higher Levels” section later in 
“Character Creation” for more information.
Note Armor Training
Your class might give you training with certain 
categories of armor. Note your armor training on 
your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of 
armor means you can wear that armor effectively, 
gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of 
armor are described in “Equipment.”
Step 2: Character Origin
Determining your character’s origin involves choos -
ing a background, a species, and two languages.
 A character’s background represents the place 
and occupation that were most formative for the 
character. The combination of background, species, 
and languages provides fertile soil for your imagi -
nation as you ponder your character’s earliest days.
Choose a Background
Choose your character’s background, and write it on 
your character sheet. You can choose any of the back -
grounds detailed in “Character Origins,” and your GM 
might offer additional backgrounds as options.
 The background you choose influences step 3, 
when you determine your character’s ability scores. 
If you’re having trouble choosing, the Ability Scores 
and Backgrounds table shows which backgrounds 
benefit which ability scores. Look for your class’s 
primary

 The background you choose influences step 3,

 Record Your Feat. A background gives you a feat, 
which grants your character particular capabilities. 
Feats are detailed in “Feats.” Write the feat on your 
character sheet.
 Note Proficiencies. Your background gives profi -
ciency in two skills and with one tool. Record this 
information on your character sheet.
 Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your 
class description in “Classes” and note the proficien -
cies on your character sheet.
 The features table in your class description shows 
your Proficiency Bonus (described in “Playing the 
Game”), which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this 
number on your character sheet. You’ll fill in other 
numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.
Choose Starting Equipment
Your background and class both provide starting 
equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step 
can be immediately spent on equipment from 
“Equipment.”
 Record your chosen equipment on your character 
sheet. Equipment is described in “Equipment,” but 
for now you can just write it all down and look up 
the specifics in “Equipment” later. Note any coins 
you have left after purchasing your equipment.
Choose a Species
Choose a species for your character. The following 
species options are detailed in “Character Origins”: 
Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, 
Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you’ve chosen a spe -
cies, write it on your character sheet. Then record 
your species’ traits.
 Your character’s size and Speed are determined 
by the character’s species; record these in the ap -
propriate places on your character sheet as well 
(you may write just the first letter of your size).
Imagine Your Past and Present
Let your character’s background and species inspire 
how you imagine their past. That past fed into the 
character’s present. With that in mind, consider an -
swers to the following questions as your character:
• Who raised you?
• Who was your dearest childhood friend?
• Did you grow up with a pet?
• Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
• Did you join an organization, such as a guild or re -
ligion? If so, are you still a member of it?
• What elements of your past inspire you to go on 
adventures now?Choose Languages
Your character knows at least three languages: 
Common plus two languages you roll or choose 
from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a 
language means your character can communicate in 
it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features 
might also give you languages.
 The Standard Languages table lists languages that 
are widespread in the setting. Every player charac -

Step 3: Ability Scores
To determine your character’s ability scores, you 
first generate a set of six numbers using the instruc -
tions below and then assign them to your six abili -
ties. “Playing the Game” explains what each ability 
means.System Reference Document 5.2.121Generate Your Scores
Determine your ability scores by using one of the 
following three methods. Your GM might prefer you 
to use a particular one.
 Standard Array.  Use the following six scores for 
your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
 Random Generation. Roll four d6s and record 
the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more 
times, so you have six numbers.
 Point Cost. You have 27 points to spend on your 
ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on 
the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a 
score of 14 costs 7 of your 27 points.

Assign Ability Scores
Once you’ve generated six scores, assign them to 
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wis -
dom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class’s 
primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.
 If you’re using the Standard Array option, consult 
the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions 
on where to assign scores for your character’s class. 
The table puts the highest scores in a class’s main 
abilities. If you used a different method to gener -
ate the scores, you may still use this table to guide 
where you place your highest and lowest scores.

Adjust Ability Scores
After assigning your ability scores, adjust them ac -
cording to your background. Your background lists 
three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None 
of these increases can raise a score above 20.
 Some players like to increase their class’s primary 
ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.
Determine Ability Modifiers
Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the 
Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modi -
fier next to each of your scores.

Step 4: Alignment
Choose your character’s alignment from the options 
below, and note it on your character sheet.
 The game assumes that player characters aren’t of 
an evil alignment. Check with your GM before mak -
ing an evil character.
The Nine Alignments
A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical 
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of 
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or 
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward 
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).
 The summaries of the alignments below describe 
the typical behavior of a creature with that align -
ment; individuals can vary from that behavior.
 Lawful Good (LG). Lawful Good creatures en -
deavor to do the right thing as expected by society. 
Someone who fights injustice and protects the inno -
cent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.
 Neutral Good (NG). Neutral Good creatures do the 
best they can, working within rules but not feeling 
bound by them. A kindly person who helps others 
according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.
 Chaotic Good (CG). Chaotic Good creatures act as 
their conscience directs with little regard for what 
others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron’s 
tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the 
poor is probably Chaotic Good.
 Lawful Neutral (LN). Lawful Neutral individuals 
act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal 
codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of 
life—and isn’t swayed either by the demands of 
those in need or by the temptations of evil—is prob -
ably Lawful Neutral.
 Neutral (N). Neutral is the alignment of those who 
prefer to avoid moral questions and don’t take sides, System Reference Document 5.2.122
unali GnEd crEatur Es
Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational 
thought don’t have alignments; they are unaligned. 
Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they 
aren’t evil; they are unaligned.
doing what seems best at the time. Someone who’s 
bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.
 Chaotic Neutral (CN). Chaotic Neutral creatures 
follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom 
above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land 
living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.
 Lawful Evil (LE). Lawful Evil creatures methodi -
cally take what they want within the limits of a code 
of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploit -
ing citizens while scheming for power is probably 
Lawful Evil.
 Neutral Evil (NE). Neutral Evil is the alignment of 
those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as 
they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and 
murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.
 Chaotic Evil (CE). Chaotic Evil creatures act 
with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred

Step 5: Character Creation Details
Now fill in the rest of your character sheet.
Record Class Features
Look at your class’s feature table in “Classes,” and 
write down the level 1 features. The class features 
are detailed there too.
  Some class features offer choices. Make sure to 
read all your features and make any offered choices.
Fill In Numbers
Note these numbers on your character sheet.
 Saving Throws. For the saving throws you have 
proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ap -
propriate ability modifier and note the total. Some 
players also like to note the modifier for saving 
throws they’re not proficient in, which is just the 
relevant ability modifier.
 Skills.  For skills you have proficiency in, add your 
Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated 
with that skill, and note the total. You might also 
wish to note the modifier for skills you’re not profi -
cient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.
 Passive Perception.  Sometimes your GM will de -
termine whether your character notices something 
without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) 
check; the GM uses your Passive Perception instead. 
Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general 
awareness of your surroundings when you’re not 
actively looking for something. Use this formula to 
determine your Passive Perception score:Passive Perception  = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) 
check modifier
Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom 
(Perception) checks. For example, if your character 
has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Percep -
tion skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 
2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency). 
 Hit Points. Your class and Constitution modifier 
determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as 
shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.
Level 1 Hit Points by Class
Class Hit Point Maximum
Barbarian 12 + Con. modifier
Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger 10 + Con. modifier
Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, 
Rogue, or Warlock8 + Con. modifier
Sorcerer or Wizard 6 + Con. modifier
The character sheet includes room to note your 
current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as 
any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There’s 
also space to track Death Saving Throws.
 Hit Point Dice. Your class’s description tells you 
the die type of your character’s Hit Point Dice (or 
Hit Dice for short); write this on your character 
sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You 
can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover 
Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space 
to note how many Hit Dice you’ve spent.
 Initiative.  Write your Dexterity modifier in the 
space for Initiative on your character sheet.
 Armor Class.  Without armor or a shield, your 
base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modi -
fier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a 
Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in 
“Equipment.” A class feature might give you a differ -
ent way to calculate your AC.
 Attacks.  In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips 
section of the character sheet, write your starting 
weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with 
which you have proficiency is one of the following 
unless a weapon’s property says otherwise:
Melee attack bonus  = Strength modifier 
+ Proficiency Bonus
Ranged attack bonus  = Dexterity modifier  
 + Proficiency Bonus
 Look up the damage and properties of your 
weapons in “Equipment.” You add the same ability 
modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your 
damage rolls with that weapon.
 Spellcasting. Note both the saving throw DC for 
your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you 
make with them, using these formulas:System Reference Document 5.2.123Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier 
+ Proficiency Bonus
Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier 
+ Proficiency Bonus
 Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is de -
termined by whatever feature gives you the ability 
to cast the spell.
 Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells. If 
your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic 
feature, your class features table shows the number 
of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips 
you know, and how many spells

you know, and how many spells you can prepare. 
Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note 
them—along with your number of spell slots—on 
your character sheet.
Level Advancement
While going on adventures, your character gains ex -
perience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A 
character who reaches a specified Experience Point 
total advances in capability. This advancement is 
called gaining a level.
 The Character Advancement table lists the XP 
you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency 
Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP 
total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience 
Points column, you reach the corresponding level.

19 305,000 +6
20 355,000 +6Gaining a Level
When you gain a level, follow these steps:
1: Choose a Class. Most characters advance in the 
same class. However, you might decide to gain a 
level in another class using the rules in the “Mul -
ticlassing” section.
2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice. Each time 
you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die. 
Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to 
the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your 
Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can 
use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points 
by Class table.
Fixed Hit Points by Class
Class Hit Points per Level
Barbarian 7 + Con. modifier
Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger 6 + Con. modifier
Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, 
Rogue, or Warlock5 + Con. modifier
Sorcerer or Wizard 4 + Con. modifier
3: Record New Class Features.  Look at your class 
features table in “Classes,” and note the features 
you gain at your new level in that class. Make any 
choices offered by a new feature.
4: Adjust Proficiency Bonus. A character’s Pro -
ficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as 
shown in the Character Advancement table and 
your class features table in “Classes.” When your 
Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the 
numbers on your character sheet that include 
your Proficiency Bonus.
5: Adjust Ability Modifiers. If you choose a feat 
that increases one or more of your ability scores, 
your ability modifier also changes if the new 
score is an even number. When that happens, ad -
just all the numbers on your character sheet that 
use that ability modifier. When your Constitution 
modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum 
increases by 1 for each level you have attained. 
For example, if a character reaches level 8 and 
increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18, 
the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The 
character’s Hit Point maximum then increases by 
8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reach -
ing level 8.
Tiers of Play
With each new level, characters acquire new ca-
pabilities that equip them to handle greater chal -
lenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of 
the game also changes, and the stakes of the cam -
paign get higher. It’s helpful to think of a character’s 
(and a campaign’s) arc in terms of four tiers of play, System Reference Document 5.2.124
Bonus  FEats at lEvEl 20
A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after 
characters reach level 20 to provide greater power 
to characters who have no more levels to gain. With 
this approach, each character gains one feat of their 
choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns 
above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially 
appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can 
choose any feat for which their level 20 character 
qualifies.describing the journey from a level 1 character just 
beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights 
of level 20. These tiers don’t have any rules associ -
ated with them; they point to the fact that the play 
experience evolves as characters gain levels.
Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)
In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers, 
though they are already set apart from the broader 
populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities. 
They learn their starting class features and choose 
a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a dan -
ger to local farmsteads or villages.
Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)
In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers.

They learn their starting class features and choose

Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)
In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers. 
Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as Fireball, Light -
ning Bolt , and Raise Dead . Most weapon-focused 
classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks 
in a round. The characters now face dangers that 
threaten cities and kingdoms.
Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)
In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power 
that makes them special among adventurers. At 
level 11, many spell  casters learn reality-altering 
spells. Other characters gain features that allow 
them to make more attacks or to do more impres -
sive things with those attacks. These adventurers 
often confront threats to whole regions.
Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)
At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their 
class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The 
fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse 
might hang in the balance during their adventures.
Starting at Higher Levels
Your GM might start your group’s characters at a 
level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended 
to start at level 3 if your group is composed of sea-
soned D&D players.
Creating Your Character
Creating a higher-level character uses the same 
character-creation steps outlined in this chapter 
and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided in the “Level Advancement” section . You begin with 
the minimum amount of XP required to reach your 
starting level. For example, if the GM starts you at 
level 10, you have 64,000 XP.
Starting Equipment
The GM decides whether your character starts with 
more than the standard equipment for a level 1 
character, possibly even one or more magic items. 
The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a 
guide for the GM.
 Also, check with your GM about what equipment 
is available for you to buy with your starting money. 
For example, the firearms described in “Equipment” 
are too expensive for level 1 characters, but they 
might be available for purchase if your GM allows 
them.
Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple 
classes. With this rule, you have the option of gain -
ing a level in a new class whenever you advance in 
level instead of gaining a level in your current class. 
Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes 
to realize a character concept that might not be re -
flected in a single class.
Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of 
at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class 
and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian 
who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must 
have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher,

and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.
Experience Points
The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on 
your total character level, not your level in a partic -
ular class, as shown in the Character Advancement 
table in “Character Creation.” For example, if you 
are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain 
enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your 
second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a 
Cleric.
Hit Points and Hit Point Dice
You gain the Hit Points from your new class as de -
scribed for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit 
Points for a class only when your total character 
level is 1.
 Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your 
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice 
are the same die type, you can pool them together. 
For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have 
a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5 
Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes 
give you Hit Dice of different types, track them sep -
arately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin, 
for example, you have five d8 Hit

a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5 
Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes 
give you Hit Dice of different types, track them sep -
arately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin, 
for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10 
Hit Dice.
Proficiency Bonus
Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total char -
acter level, not your level in a particular class, as 
shown in the Character Advancement table. For 
example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue, 
you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 charac -
ter, which is +3.
Proficiencies
When you gain your first level in a class other than 
your initial class, you gain only some of the new 
class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each 
class’s description in “Classes.”
Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its fea-
tures for that level. A few features have additional 
rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the infor -
mation about multiclassing included in each of your 
classes’ descriptions.
 Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting, 
and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give 
you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.
Armor Class
If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor 
Class, you can benefit from only one at a time. 
For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Dra-
conic Resilience feature must choose only one of 
those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.
Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than 
one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make 
more than two attacks with this feature unless you 
have a feature that says you can (such as the Fight -
er’s Two Extra Attacks feature).
 Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invo -
cation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature 
with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional 
attacks if you also have Extra Attack.
Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on 
your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes 
and partly on your individual levels in those classes. 
Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more 
than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass 
but have the Spellcasting feature from only one 
class, follow the rules for that class.
 Spells Prepared.  You determine what spells you 
can prepare for each class individually, as if you 
were a single-classed member of that class. If you 
are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example, 
you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you 
can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as 
well as four Sorcerer cantrips). 
 Each spell you prepare is associated with one of 
your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of 
that class when you cast the spell.
 Cantrips.  If a cantrip of yours increases in power 
at higher levels, the increase is based on your total 
character level, not your level in a particular class, 
unless the spell says otherwise.
 Spell Slots. You determine your available spell 
slots by adding together the following:
• All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, 
and Wizard classes
• Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and 
Ranger classes
Then look up this total level in the Level column of 
the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for 
that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from 
any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.
 This table might give you spell slots of a higher 
level than the spells you prepare. You can use those 
slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a 
lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands , 
has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level, 
you can use the enhanced effect as normal.
 For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 
Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when de -
termining your spell slots, counting all your levels 
as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown System Reference Document 5.2.126in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four 
level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3 
slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells, 
nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You 
can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the 
spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance 
their effects.
 Pact Magic. If you have the Pact Magic feature 
from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature, 
you can

 Damage Resistance.  You have Resistance to Blud -
geoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
 Rage Damage.  When you make an attack using 
Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed 
Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain 
a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain 
levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage 
column of the Barbarian Features table.
 Strength Advantage.  You have Advantage on 
Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
 No Concentration or Spells. You can’t maintain 
Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.
 Duration.  The Rage lasts until the end of your 
next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor 
or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage 
is still active on your next turn, you can extend 
the Rage for another round by doing one of the 
following:
• Make an attack roll against an enemy.
• Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
• Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.
Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end 
of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 
10 minutes.
Level 1: Unarmored Defense
While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Ar -
mor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Consti -
tution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain 
this benefit.
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the 
mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Mar -
tial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Great -
axes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long 
Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one 
of those weapon choices.
 When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain 
the ability to use the mastery properties of more 
kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery 
column of the Barbarian Features table.
Level 2: Danger Sense
You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as 
they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge 
perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving 
throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.
Level 2: Reckless Attack
You can throw aside all concern for defense to at -
tack with increased ferocity. When you make your 
first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to at -
tack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on at -
tack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage 
during that time.
Level 3: Barbarian Subclass
You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The 
Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this 
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization 
that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. 
For the rest of your career, you gain each of your 
subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level 
or lower.
Level 3: Primal Knowledge
You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice 
from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.
 In addition, while your Rage is active, you can 
channel primal power when you attempt certain 
tasks; whenever you make an ability check using 
one of the following skills, you can make it as a 
Strength check even if it normally uses a differ -
ent ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, 
Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your 
Strength represents primal power coursing through 
you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you

ent ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception,

Strength represents primal power coursing through 
you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see 
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you 
qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian lev -
els 8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you 
take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Fast Movement
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t 
wearing Heavy armor.
Level 7: Feral Instinct
Your instincts are so honed that you have Advan -
tage on Initiative rolls.
Level 7: Instinctive Pounce
As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your 
Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.
Level 9: Brutal Strike
If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Ad -
vantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your 
choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t 
have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the 
target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type 
dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can 
cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You 
have the following effect options.
 Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet 
straight away from you. You can then move up to 
half your Speed straight toward the target without 
provoking Opportunity Attacks.System Reference Document 5.2.130 Hamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by 
15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can 
be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—
the most recent one.
Level 11: Relentless Rage
Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous 
wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage 
is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 
10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your 
Hit Points instead change to a number equal to 
twice your Barbarian level.
 Each time you use this feature after the first, the 
DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long 
Rest, the DC resets to 10.
Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike
You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The 
following effects are now among your Brutal Strike 
options.
 Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on 
the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make 
Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next 
turn.
 Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next 
turn, the next attack roll made by another creature 
against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An 
attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.
Level 15: Persistent Rage
When you roll Initiative, you can regain all ex -
pended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage 
in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a 
Long Rest.
 In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts 
for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything 
to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends 
early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just 
the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.
Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike
The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 
2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal 
Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike 
feature.
Level 18: Indomitable Might
If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving 
throw is less than your Strength score, you can use 
that score in place of the total.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another

The damage has the same type as the weapon or 
Unarmed Strike used for the attack.
Level 6: Mindless Rage
You have Immunity to the Charmed and Fright -
ened conditions while your Rage is active.

shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Fea-
tures table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at 
level 10, and a d12 at level 15.
Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through your bardic 
arts. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The 
information below details how you use those rules 
with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list 
later in the class’s description.
 Cantrips.  You know two cantrips of your choice 
from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights  and Vicious 
Mockery  are recommended.
 Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace 
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your 
choice from the Bard spell list.
 When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn 
another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell 
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard 
Features table.
 Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how 
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ 
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin -
ish a Long Rest.
 Prepared Spells of Level 1+.  You prepare the 
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to 
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 
spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person , Color 
Spray , Dissonant Whispers , and Healing Word are 
recommended.
 The number of spells on your list increases as you 
gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells 
column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that 
number increases, choose additional spells from the 
Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list 
matches the number on the table. The chosen spells 
must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 
2 in any combination.
 If another Bard feature gives you spells that you 
always have prepared, those spells don’t count 
against the number of spells you can prepare with 
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as 
Bard spells for you.
 Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you 
gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your 
list with another Bard spell for which you have spell 
slots.
 Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcast -
ing ability for your Bard spells.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instru -
ment as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.
Level 2: Expertise
You gain Expertise (see “Rules Glossary”) in two of 
your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance 
and Persuasion are recommended if you have profi -
ciency in them.
 At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of 
your skill proficiencies of your choice.
Level 2: Jack of All Trades
You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round 
down) to any ability check you make that uses a 
skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise 
use your Proficiency Bonus.
 For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics) 
check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add 
half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.
Level 3: Bard Subclass
You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College 
of Lore subclass is detailed after this class’s descrip -
tion. A subclass is a specialization that grants you 
features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your 
career, you gain each of your subclass’s features 
that are of your Bard level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see 
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you 
qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 
12, and 16.
Level 5: Font of Inspiration
You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic In -
spiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
 In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action 
required) to regain one expended use of Bardic 
Inspiration.System Reference Document 5.2.133Level 7: Countercharm
You can use musical notes or words of power to dis -
rupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature 
within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an 
effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened con -
dition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to 
be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

tions. Whenever you reach

tions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including 
this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the 
Bard Features table increases, you can choose any 
of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric, 
Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells 
count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for 
its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a 
spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with 
a spell from those lists.
Level 18: Superior Inspiration
When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses 
of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have 
fewer than that.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another 
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of 
Spell Recall is recommended.
Level 20: Words of Creation
You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: 
the words of life and death. You therefore always 
have the Power Word Heal  and Power Word Kill 
spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can 
target a second creature with it if that creature is 
within 10 feet of the first target.
Bard Spell List
This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells 
are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, 
and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Spe -
cial column, C means the spell requires Concentra-
tion, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a 
specific Material component.

fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration;

another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell 
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric 
Features table.
 Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how 
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ 
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin -
ish a Long Rest.
 Prepared Spells of Level 1+.  You prepare the list 
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast 
with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells 
from the Cleric spell list. Bless , Cure Wounds , Guiding 
Bolt , and Shield of Faith are recommended.
 The number of spells on your list increases as you 
gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells 
column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that 
number increases, choose additional spells from the 
Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your 
list matches the number on the table. The chosen 
spells must be of a level for which you have spell 
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list 
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 
and 2 in any combination.
 If another Cleric feature gives you spells that 
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count 
against the number of spells you can prepare with 
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as 
Cleric spells for you.
 Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you 
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of pre -
pared spells, replacing any of the spells there with 
other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.
 Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting 
ability for your Cleric spells.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as 
a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.
Level 1: Divine Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following 
sacred roles of your choice.
 Protector.  Trained for battle, you gain proficiency 
with Martial weapons and training with Heavy 
armor.
 Thaumaturge.  You know one extra cantrip from 
the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical con -
nection to the divine gives you a bonus to your 
Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus 
equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).
Level 2: Channel Divinity
You can channel divine energy directly from the 
Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with 
two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, 
each of which is described below. Each time you use 
this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel 
Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain ad -
ditional effect options at higher Cleric levels. You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. 
You regain one of its expended uses when you finish 
a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when 
you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses 
when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in 
the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features 
table.
 If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving 
throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this 
class’s Spellcasting feature.
 Divine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your 
Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 
30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. 
Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either 
restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total 
or force the creature to make a Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic 
or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that to -
tal. On a successful save, the creature takes half as 
much damage (round down).
 You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric 
levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).
 Turn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your 
Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each 
Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must 
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails 
its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated 
conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries 
to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This 
effect ends early on the creature if it takes any dam -
age, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if 
you die.
Level 3: Cleric Subclass
You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life 
Domain subclass is detailed after this class’s de -
scription. A

Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each 
Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must 
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails 
its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated 
conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries 
to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This 
effect ends early on the creature if it takes any dam -
age, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if 
you die.
Level 3: Cleric Subclass
You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life 
Domain subclass is detailed after this class’s de -
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants 
you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of 
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Cleric level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see 
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you 
qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 
12, and 16.
Level 5: Sear Undead
Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a 
number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier 
(minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each 
Undead that fails its saving throw against that use 
of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the 
roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.System Reference Document 5.2.138Level 7: Blessed Strikes
Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of 
the following options of your choice (if you get ei -
ther option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, 
use only the option you choose for this feature).
 Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when 
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a 
weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 
1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).
 Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier 
to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.
Level 10: Divine Intervention
You can call on your deity or pantheon to inter -
vene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any 
Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a 
Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast 
that spell without expending a spell slot or needing 
Material components. You can’t use this feature 
again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes
The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows 
more powerful.
 Divine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine 
Strike increases to 2d8.
 Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric can -
trip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can 
give vitality to yourself or another creature within 
60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary 
Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another 
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of 
Fate is recommended.
Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention
You can call on even more powerful divine interven -
tion. When you use your Divine Intervention fea-
ture, you can choose Wish when you select a spell. 
If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again 
until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.

This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells 
are organized by spell level and then alphabetized,

Cleric Subclass: Life Domain
Soothe the Hurts of the World
The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that 
helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who 
tap into this domain are masters of healing, using 
that life force to cure many hurts.
 Existence itself relies on the positive energy as -
sociated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any 
religious tradition might choose it. This domain is 
particularly associated with agricultural deities, 
gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and 
community. Religious orders of healing also seek 
the magic of this domain.
Level 3: Disciple of Life
When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit 
Points to a creature, that creature regains addi -
tional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The 
additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s 
level.Level 3: Life Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you 
always have certain spells ready. When you reach 
a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells 
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells 
prepared.
Life Domain Spells
Cleric 
LevelPrepared Spells
3 Aid, Bless , Cure Wound s, 
Lesser Restoration
5 Mass Healing Word , Revivify
7 Aura of Life , Death Ward
9 Greater Restoration , Mass Cure Wounds
Level 3: Preserve Life
As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol 
and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke 
healing energy that can restore a number of Hit 
Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose 
Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which 
can include you), and divide those Hit Points among 
them. This feature can restore a creature to no 
more than half its Hit Point maximum.
Level 6: Blessed Healer
The healing spells you cast on others heal you as 
well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell 
slot that restores Hit Points to one or more crea-
tures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points 
equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.
Level 17: Supreme Healing
When you would normally roll one or more dice to 
restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Chan -
nel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; in -
stead use the highest number possible for each die. 
For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a 
creature with a spell, you restore 12.System Reference Document 5.2.141Druid

appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s 
description.
 Cantrips.  You know two cantrips of your choice 
from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft  and Produce 
Flame  are recommended.
 Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace 
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your 
choice from the Druid spell list.
 When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn 
another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell 
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid 
Features table.
 Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how 
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ 
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin -
ish a Long Rest.
 Prepared Spells of Level 1+.  You prepare the 
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to 
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 
spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship , 
Cure Wounds , Faerie Fire , and Thunderwave  are 
recommended.
 The number of spells on your list increases as you 
gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells 
column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that 
number increases, choose additional spells from the 
Druid spell list until the number of spells on your 
list matches the number on the table. The chosen 
spells must be of a level for which you have spell 
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list 
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 
and 2 in any combination.
 If another Druid feature gives you spells that 
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count 
against the number of spells you can prepare with 
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as 
Druid spells for you.
 Changing Your Prepared Spells.  Whenever you 
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of pre -
pared spells, replacing any of the spells with other 
Druid spells for which you have spell slots.
 Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting 
ability for your Druid spells.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus 
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.
Level 1: Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. 
While learning this ancient tongue, you also un -
locked the magic of communicating with animals; 
you always have the Speak with Animals  spell 
prepared.
 You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You 
and others who know Druidic automatically spot 
such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check but can’t decipher it without magic.
Level 1: Primal Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following 
sacred roles of your choice.

(see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form 
for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level 
or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapac -
itated condition, or die. You can also leave the form 
early as a Bonus Action.
 Number of Uses.  You can use Wild Shape twice. 
You regain one expended use when you finish a 
Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when 
you finish a Long Rest.
 You gain additional uses when you reach certain 
Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of 
the Druid Features table.
 Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this 
feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that 
have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that 
lack a Fly Speed (see “Animals” in “Monsters” for 
stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider , 
and Wolf  are recommended. Whenever you finish a 
Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms 
with another eligible form.
 When you reach certain Druid levels, your number 
of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating 
for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast 
Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can 
adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.
 When choosing known forms, you may look in 
other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master 
permits you to do so.

retain your personality, memories, and ability to 
speak, and the following rules apply:
Temporary Hit Points.  When you assume a Wild 
Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit 
Points equal to your Druid level.
Game Statistics.  Your game statistics are replaced 
by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your crea-
ture type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, 
Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; 
languages; and feats. You also retain your skill 
and saving throw proficiencies and use your Pro -
ficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the 
proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving 
throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher 
than yours, use the one in the stat block.
No Spellcasting.  You can’t cast spells, but shape- 
shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or oth -
erwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.
Objects.  Your ability to handle objects is deter -
mined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. 
In addition, you choose whether your equipment 
falls in your space, merges into your new form, or 
is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as nor -
mal, but the GM decides whether it’s practical for 
the new form to wear a piece of equipment based 
on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment 
doesn’t change size or shape to match the new 
form, and any equipment that the new form can’t 
wear must either fall to the ground or merge with 
the form. Equipment that merges with the form 
has no effect while you’re in that form.
Level 2: Wild Companion
You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an 
animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can 
expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the 
Find Familiar  spell without Material components.
 When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is 
Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Druid Subclass
You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle 
of the Land subclass is detailed after this class’s de -
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants 
you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of 
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Druid level or lower.

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see 
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you

You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle 
of the Land subclass is detailed after this class’s de -
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants 
you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of 
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Druid level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see 
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you 
qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 
12, and 16.Level 5: Wild Resurgence
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of 
Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by ex -
pending a spell slot (no action required).
 In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape 
(no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell 
slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long 
Rest.
Level 7: Elemental Fury
The might of the elements flows through you. You 
gain one of the following options of your choice.
 Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier 
to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.
 Primal Strike. Once on each of your turns when 
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a 
weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you 
can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, 
Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you 
hit).
Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury
The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows 
more powerful, as detailed below.
 Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Druid can -
trip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s 
range increases by 300 feet.
 Primal Strike. The extra damage of your Primal 
Strike increases to 2d8.
Level 18: Beast Spells
While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast 
form, except for any spell that has a Material com -
ponent with a cost specified or that consumes its 
Material component.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another 
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Di -
mensional Travel is recommended.
Level 20: Archdruid
The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, 
granting you the following benefits.
 Evergreen Wild Shape.  Whenever you roll Initia -
tive and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain 
one expended use of it.
 Nature Magician.  You can convert uses of Wild 
Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose 
a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape 
and convert them into a single spell slot, with each 
use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you 
convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 
4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do 
so again until you finish a Long Rest.
 Longevity.  The primal magic that you wield 
causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years 
that pass, your body ages only one year.System Reference Document 5.2.144Druid Spell List

Circle of the Land
Celebrate Connection to the Natural World
The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages 
who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These 
Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or stand -
ing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The 
circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests 
of their communities.
Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type 
of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult 
the table below that corresponds to the chosen 
type; you have the spells listed for your Druid level 
and lower prepared.

As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild 
Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. 
Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns 
appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere cen -
tered on that point. Each creature of your choice in 
the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw 
against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic 
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on 
a successful one. One creature of your choice in that 
area regains 2d6 Hit Points.
 The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when 
you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).
Level 6: Natural Recovery
You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have 
prepared from your Circle Spells feature without 
expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long 
Rest before you do so again.
 In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can 
choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell 
slots can have a combined level that is equal to or 
less than half your Druid level (round up), and none 
of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 
6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of 
spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 
2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. 
Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you 
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Nature’s Ward
You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you 
have Resistance to a damage type associated with 
your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature, 
as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.

starting at level 13 and three times before a Long 
Rest starting at level 17.

Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your 
Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.
Level 2: Monk’s Focus
Your focus and martial training allow you to har -

Monk Features table.
 You can expend these points to enhance or fuel 
certain Monk features. You start knowing three 
such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and

until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of 
which you regain all your expended points.

plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

make two Unarmed Strikes as a Bonus Action.

start of your next turn. On a successful save, the 
target’s Speed is halved until the start of your next 
turn, and the next attack roll made against the tar -
get before then has Advantage.
Level 6: Empowered Strikes

Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its 
normal damage type.

provoke Opportunity Attacks.

of the following conditions from yourself at the

BrEakin G your oatH
A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of 
conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. 
Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.
 A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks 
absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of pen -
itence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgive -
ness, the Paladin starts fresh.
 If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, 
talk to your GM. Your Paladin should probably take a 
more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class 
and adopt another one. As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature 
(which could be yourself) and draw power from the 
pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to 
that creature, up to the maximum amount remain -
ing in the pool.
 You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of 
healing power to remove the Poisoned condition 
from the creature; those points don’t also restore 
Hit Points to the creature.
Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and 
meditation. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcast -
ing. The information below details how you use 
those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the 
Paladin spell list later in the class’s description.
 Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows 
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ 
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin -
ish a Long Rest.
 Prepared Spells of Level 1+ . You prepare the 
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to 
cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 
1 Paladin spells. Heroism  and Searing Smite  are 
recommended.
 The number of spells on your list increases as 
you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared 
Spells column of the Paladin Features table. When -
ever that number increases, choose additional 
Paladin spells until the number of spells on your 
list matches the number in the Paladin Features 
table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which 
you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 
Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six 
Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
 If another Paladin feature gives you spells that 
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count 
against the number of spells you can prepare with 
this feature, but those spells otherwise count

choice with which you have proficiency, such as 
Longswords and Javelins. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change 
the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you 
could switch to using the mastery properties of Hal -
berds and Flails.
Level 2: Fighting Style
You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see 
“Feats” for feats). Instead of choosing one of those 
feats, you can choose the option below.
 Blessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of 
your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a list 
of Cleric spells). Guidance  and Sacred Flame  are rec -
ommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin 
spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting 
ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, 
you can replace one of these cantrips with another 
Cleric cantrip.
Level 2: Paladin’s Smite
You always have the Divine Smite  spell prepared. In 
addition, you can cast it without expending a spell 
slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can 
cast it in this way again.
Level 3: Channel Divinity
You can channel divine energy directly from the 
Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You 
start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is 
described below. Other Paladin features give addi -
tional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time 
you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose 
which effect from this class to create.
 You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. 
You regain one of its expended uses when you finish 
a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when 
you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use 
when you reach Paladin level 11.System Reference Document 5.2.155 If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving 
throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this 
class’s Spellcasting feature.
 Divine Sense. As a Bonus Action, you can open 
your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and 
Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have 
the Incapacitated condition, you know the location 
of any creature of those types within 60 feet of 
yourself, and you know its creature type. Within 
the same radius, you also detect the presence of any 
place or object that has been consecrated or dese -
crated, as with the Hallow  spell.
Level 3: Paladin Subclass
You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath 
of Devotion subclass is detailed after this class’s de -
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants 
you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest 
of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Paladin level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see 
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you 
qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 
8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you 
take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Faithful Steed
You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You 
always have the Find Steed  spell prepared.
 You can also cast the spell once without expend -
ing a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so 
when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 6: Aura of Protection
You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot 
Emanation that originates from you. The aura is in -
active while you have the Incapacitated condition.
 You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to 
saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier 
(minimum bonus of +1).
 If another Paladin is present, a creature can ben -
efit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the 
creature chooses which aura while in them.

you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target 
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the 
Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes

can do only one of the following on its turns: move, 
take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order
The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals 
of justice and order. These Paladins meet the ar -
chetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold 
themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and 
some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the 
world to the same standards.
 Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods 
of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the 
measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as 
their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings 
into their helmets or coats of arms. 
 These paladins share the following tenets:
•  Let your word be your promise.
•  Protect the weak and never fear to act.
•  Let your honorable deeds be an example.
Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have 
certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level 
specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you 
thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

Level 5: Cunning Strike
You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak 
Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you 
can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. 
Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of 
Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the 
effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the 
effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage 
is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, 
remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before 
rolling.
 If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, 
the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and 
Proficiency Bonus.
 Poison (Cost: 1d6). You add a toxin to your strike, 
forcing the target to make a Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned 
condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its 
turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending 
the effect on itself on a success.
 To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner’s Kit 
on your person.
 Trip (Cost: 1d6). If the target is Large or smaller, 
it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have 
the Prone condition.
 Withdraw (Cost: 1d6). Immediately after the 
attack, you move up to half your Speed without pro -
voking Opportunity Attacks.
Level 5: Uncanny Dodge
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an 
attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the at -
tack’s damage against you (round down).
Level 7: Evasion
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dan -
gers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows 
you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only 
half damage, you instead take no damage if you 
succeed on the saving throw and only half damage 
if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the 
Incapacitated condition.Level 7: Reliable Talent
Whenever you make an ability check that uses one 
of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a 
d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike
You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when 
you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost 
for each effect.
Level 14: Devious Strikes
You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack 
deviously. The following effects are now among 
your Cunning Strike options.
 Daze (Cost: 2d6). The target must succeed on a 
Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can 
do only one of the following: move or take an action 
or a Bonus Action.
 Knock Out (Cost: 6d6). The target must succeed 
on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Uncon -
scious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any 
damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save 
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on 
itself on a success.
 Obscure (Cost: 3d6). The target must succeed on 
a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded con -
dition until the end of its next turn.

trol. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma

els 8, 12, and 16.

Sorcerer Subclass: Draconic 
Sorcery
Breathe the Magic of Dragons
Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. 
Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed 
some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. 
You might have absorbed magic from a site infused 
with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a 
treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was 
steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a 
dragon for an ancestor.
Level 3: Draconic Resilience
The magic in your body manifests physical traits 
of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum in -
creases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you 
gain another Sorcerer level.
 Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like 
scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base 
Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Cha-
risma modifiers.System Reference Document 5.2.170Level 3: Draconic Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the 
Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have 
the listed spells prepared.
Draconic Spells
Sorcerer 
Level Spells
3 Alter Self , Chromatic Orb , Command , 
Dragon’s Breath
5 Fear, Fly
7 Arcane Eye , Charm Monster
9 Legend Lore , Summon Dragon
Level 6: Elemental Affinity
Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage 
type associated with dragons. Choose one of those 
types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.
 You have Resistance to that damage type, and 
when you cast a spell that deals damage of that 
type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one 
damage roll of that spell.
Level 14: Dragon Wings
As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to 
appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or 
until you dismiss them (no action required). For the 
duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again 
until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 3 Sor -
cery Points (no action required) to restore your use 
of it.
Level 18: Dragon Companion
You can cast Summon Dragon  without a Material 
component. You can also cast it once without a spell 
slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way 
when you finish a Long Rest.
 Whenever you start casting the spell, you can 
modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If 
you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for 
that casting.Warlock

ing magical ability or other lessons. You gain one in -

vocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation 
Options” section later in this class’s description.

ing magical ability or other lessons. You gain one in -
vocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. In -
vocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation

 Prerequisites.  If an invocation has a prerequi -
site, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For 
example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 
5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you 
reach Warlock level 5.
 Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever 
you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of 
your invocations with another one for which you System Reference Document 5.2.171qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a pre -
requisite for another invocation that you have.
 When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain 
more invocations of your choice, as shown in the In -
vocations column of the Warlock Features table.
 You can’t pick the same invocation more than once 
unless its description says otherwise.
Level 1: Pact Magic
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact 
with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. 
The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity 
unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability 
to cast spells. See “Spells” for the rules on spell -
casting. The information below details how you use 
those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the 
Warlock spell list later in the class’s description.
 Cantrips.  You know two Warlock cantrips of your 
choice. Eldritch Blast  and Prestidigitation  are rec -
ommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you 
can replace one of your cantrips from this feature 
with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.
 When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you 
learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as 
shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Fea-
tures table. Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows 
how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock 
spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level 
of those slots, all of which are the same level. You 
regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you 
finish a Short or Long Rest.
 For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you 
have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell 
Charm Person , you must spend one of those slots, 
and you cast it as a level 3 spell.
 Prepared Spells of Level 1+.  You prepare the 
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you 
to cast with this feature. To start, choose two 
level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person  and Hex  are 
recommended.
 The number of spells on your list increases as you 
gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells 
column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever 
that number increases, choose additional War -
lock spells until the number of spells on your list 
matches the number in the table. The chosen spells 
must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in 
the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When 
you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new War -
lock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.
 If another Warlock feature gives you spells that 
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count Warlock Features

slots but no more than a number equal to half your 
maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you 
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Warlock Subclass
You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The 
Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class’s 
description. A subclass is a specialization that 
grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For 
the rest of your career, you gain each of your sub -
class’s features that are of your Warlock level or 
lower.

“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you 
qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 
8, 12, and 16.
Level 9: Contact Patron
In the past, you usually contacted your patron 
through intermediaries. Now you can communicate 
directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane  
spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the 
spell without expending a spell slot to contact your 
patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s 
saving throw.
 Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t 
do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 11: Mystic Arcanum
Your patron grants you a magical secret called an 
arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this 
arcanum.
 You can cast your arcanum spell once without ex -
pending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest 
before you can cast it in this way again.
 As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain 
another Warlock spell of your choice that can be 
cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 
13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 
spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum 
when you finish a Long Rest. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can re -
place one of your arcanum spells with another War -
lock spell of the same level.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another 
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of 
Fate is recommended.

When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you 
regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

your familiar to make one attack of its own with its 
Reaction.
Pact of the Tome
Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure 
forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or

appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you 
can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with 
this feature or if you die.
 Cantrips and Rituals.  When the book appears, 
choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells 
that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any

Spellcasting Focus.

Warlock Subclass: Fiend Patron
Make a Deal with the Lower Planes
Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of 
perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon 
lord, an archdevil, or another fiend that is especially 
mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption 
or destruction of all things, ultimately including 
you—and your path is defined by the extent to 
which you strive against those aims.
Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing
When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain 
Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma mod -
ifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Tempo -
rary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit if someone 
else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit 
Points.
Level 3: Fiend Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have 
certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock 
level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereaf -
ter always have the listed spells prepared.Fiend Spells
Warlock Level Spells
3 Burning Hands , Command , 
Scorching Ray , Suggestion
5 Fireball , Stinking Cloud
7 Fire Shield , Wall of Fire
9 Geas, Insect Plague
Level 6: Dark One’s Own Luck
You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate 
in your favor. When you make an ability check or a 
saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 
to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but 
before any of the roll’s effects occur.
 You can use this feature a number of times equal 
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but 
you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain 
all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Fiendish Resilience
Choose one damage type, other than Force, when -
ever you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resis -
tance to that damage type until you choose a differ -
ent one with this feature.
Level 14: Hurl Through Hell
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an 
attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the 
target through the Lower Planes. The target must 
succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your 
spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles 
through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 
8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the 
Incapacitated condition until the end of your next 
turn, when it returns to the space it previously oc -
cupied or the nearest unoccupied space.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again 
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a 
Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore 
your use of it.System Reference Document 5.2.177Wizard

Expandin G and rEplacin G a spEllBook
The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain 
levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you 
might find other spells during your adventures that 
you can add to the book. You could discover a Wiz -
ard spell on a Spell Scroll , for example, and then copy 
it into your spellbook.
 Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find 
a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your 
spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you 
have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the 
transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. After -
ward you can prepare the spell like the other spells 
in your spellbook.
 Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from 
your spellbook into another book. This is like copy -
ing a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since 
you already know how to cast the spell. You need 
spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the 
copied spell.
 If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same 
procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you 
have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the 
remainder of the new book requires you to find new 
spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a 
backup spellbook. When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn 
another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in 
the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.
 Spellbook.  Your wizardly apprenticeship cul -
minated in the creation of a unique book: your 
spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, 
contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or 
someone casting Identify . You determine the book’s 
appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome 
or a collection of vellum bound with twine.
 The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It 
starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. 
Detect Magic , Feather Fall, Mage Armor , Magic Mis-
sile, Sleep , and Thunderwave  are recommended.
 Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two 
Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each 
of these spells must be of a level for which you have 
spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. 
The spells are the culmination of arcane research 
you do regularly.
 Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows 
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ 
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin -
ish a Long Rest.
 Prepared Spells of Level 1+.  You prepare the list 
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast

your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level 
for which you have spell slots.

you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells 
can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combi -
nation, chosen from your spellbook.
 If another Wizard feature gives you spells that 
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count 
against the number of spells you can prepare with 
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as 
Wizard spells for you.
 Changing Your Prepared Spells.  Whenever you 
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of pre -
pared spells, replacing any of the spells there with 
spells from your spellbook.
 Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcast -
ing ability for your Wizard spells.
 Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus 
or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your 
Wizard spells.
Level 1: Ritual Adept
You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has 
the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read 
from the book to cast a spell in this way.
Level 1: Arcane Recovery
You can regain some of your magical energy by 
studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short 
Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to re -
cover. The spell slots can have a combined level 
equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round 
up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. 
For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can re -
cover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regain -
ing either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell 
slots.
 Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again 
until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 2: Scholar
While studying magic, you also specialized in an -
other field of study. Choose one of the following 
skills in which you have proficiency: Arcana, His -
tory, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, or Religion. 
You have Expertise in the chosen skill.
Level 3: Wizard Subclass
You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The 
Evoker subclass is detailed after this class’s de -
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants 
you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest System Reference Document 5.2.179of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Wizard level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see 
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you 
qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 
8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Memorize Spell
Whenever you finish a Short Rest, you can study 
your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wiz-
ard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting 
feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.
Level 18: Spell Mastery
You have achieved such mastery over certain spells 
that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and 
a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting 
time of an action. You always have those spells pre -
pared, and you can cast them at their lowest level 
without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at 
a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.
 Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study 
your spellbook and replace one of those spells with 
an eligible spell of the same level from the book.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another 
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of 
Spell Recall is recommended.
Level 20: Signature Spells
Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your 
signature spells. You always have these spells pre -
pared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 
without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you 
can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a 
Short or Long Rest. To cast either spell at a higher 
level, you must expend a spell slot.

Wizard Subclass: Evoker
Create Explosive Elemental Effects
Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful 
elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, 
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning 
acid. Some Evokers find employment in military 
forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from 
afar. Others use their power to protect others, while 
some seek their own gain.Level 3: Evocation Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation 
school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, 
and add them to your spellbook for free.
 In addition, whenever you gain access to a new 
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wiz-
ard spell from the Evocation school to your spell -
book for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for 
which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Potent Cantrip
Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that 
avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a can -
trip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll 
or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the 
cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage 
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the 
cantrip.
Level 6: Sculpt Spells
You can create pockets of relative safety within the 
effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evoca-
tion spell that affects other creatures that you can 
see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 
plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automat -
ically succeed on their saving throws against the 
spell, and they take no damage if they would nor -
mally take half damage on a successful save.
Level 10: Empowered Evocation
Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evoca-
tion school, you can add your Intelligence modifier 
to one damage roll of that spell.
Level 14: Overchannel
You can increase the power of your spells. When 
you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 
that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage 
with that spell on the turn you cast it.
 The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse ef -
fect. If you use this feature again before you finish a 
Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each 
level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. 
This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.
 Each time you use this feature again before finish -
ing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level 
increases by 1d12.System Reference Document 5.2.183Character Origins

Character Species
When you choose your character’s species, you 
determine whether your character is a human or a 
member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn 
or gnome.
 The peoples of the multiverse hail from different 
worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms. 
A player character’s species is the set of game traits 
that an adventurer gains from being one of those 
life forms.
 Some species can trace their origin to a single 
world, plane of existence, or god, while other spe -
cies first appeared in multiple realms at once. 
Whatever a species’ genesis, its members have 
spread across the multiverse and contribute to 
many different cultures.
 Members of most species live for about 80 years, 
with exceptions noted in the text about the spe -
cies in “Character Origins.” Regardless of life span, 
members of all species reach physical maturity at 
about the same age. Your character can be any age 
that isn’t beyond their species’ normal life span.
Parts of a Species
A species includes the following parts.
Creature Type
A character’s species determines the character’s 
creature type, which is described in “Rules Glos -
sary.” Every species in “Character Origins” is Hu -
manoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in 
other books.
Size
Your character’s species determines the character’s 
size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range 
of heights, and some species include such diversity System Reference Document 5.2.184of size that you can choose whether your character 
is Small or Medium.
Speed
Your character’s species determines the character’s 
Speed.
Special Traits
Each species gives a character special traits—
unique characteristics based on the species’ physi -
ology or magical nature. When you choose a species, 
your character gets all the special traits listed for it. 
Some traits involve making a choice from a handful 
of options.
Species Descriptions

Size: Medium (about 5–7 feet tall)
Speed:  30 feet
As a Dragonborn, you have these special traits.

15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide 
(choose the shape each time). Each creature in that 
area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus 
your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). 
On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of 
the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry 
trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as 
much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when 
you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 
17 (4d10).  
 You can use this Breath Weapon a number of 
times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you re -

or until you retract the wings (no action required) 
or have the Incapacitated condition. During that 
time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your

the ability when you select the lineage):
Forest Gnome.  You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. 
You also always have the Speak with Animals  spell

from Prestidigitation ; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a 
Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the cho -
sen effect has options within it, you choose one of 
those options for the device when you create it. 
For example, if you choose the spell’s ignite-extin -
guish effect, you determine whether the device 
ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn’t do

Characters often find coins on their adventures 
and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other 
businesses. Coins come in different denominations 
based on the relative worth of their material. The 
Coin Values table lists coins and how much they’re 
worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game’s

Weapons
The Weapons table in this section shows the game’s 
main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of 
each weapon, as well as the following details:
Category.  Every weapon falls into a category: Sim -
ple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually 
tied to one of these categories. For example, you 
might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
Melee or Ranged. A weapon is classified as either 
Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to at -
tack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged 
weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
Damage.  The table lists the amount of damage a 
weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well 
as the type of that damage.
Properties.  Any properties a weapon has are listed 
in the Properties column. Each property is de -
fined in the “Properties” section.
Mastery.  Each weapon has a mastery property, 
which is defined in the “Mastery Properties” sec -
tion. To use that property, you must have a feature 
that lets you use it.Weapon Proficiency
Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have 
proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to 
an attack roll you make with it. A player character’s 
features can provide weapon proficiencies. A mon -
ster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.
Properties
Here are definitions of the properties in the Proper -
ties column of the Weapons table.
Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition 
property to make a ranged attack only if you have 
ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition 
required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each 
attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing 
the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a 
free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a 
fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the 
ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the 
rest is lost.
Finesse
When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use 
your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier 
for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the 
same modifier for both rolls.
Heavy
You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy 
weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength 
score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and 
your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.
Light
When you take the Attack action on your turn and 
attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra 
attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. 
That extra attack must be made with a different 
Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modi -
fier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modi -
fier is negative. For example, you can attack with a 
Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other 
using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you 
don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the 
damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modi -
fier is negative.System Reference Document 5.2.190

If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, 
or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised 
Weapons” in “Rules Glossary.” Also see those rules 
if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using 
a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.Loading
You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a 
Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus 
Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the 
number of attacks you can normally make.
Range
A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after 
the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range 
lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal 
range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long 
range. When attacking a target beyond normal 
range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You 
can’t attack a target beyond the long range.
Reach
A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you 
attack with it, as well as when determining your 
reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.
Thrown
If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can 
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and 
you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If 
the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability 
modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you 
use for a melee attack with that weapon.
Two-Handed
A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when 
you attack with it.
Versatile
A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two 
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with 
the property. The weapon deals that damage when 
used with two hands to make a melee attack.
Mastery Properties
Each weapon has a mastery property, which is us -
able only by a character who has a feature, such as 
Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the 
character. The properties are defined below.Cleave
If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using 
this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with 
the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet 
of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, 
the second creature takes the weapon’s damage, 
but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage 
unless that modifier is negative. You can make this 
extra attack only once per turn.
Graze
If your attack roll with this weapon misses a crea-
ture, you can deal damage to that creature equal 
to the ability modifier you used to make the attack 
roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the 
weapon, and the damage can be increased only by 
increasing the ability modifier.
Nick
When you make the extra attack of the Light prop -
erty, you can make it as part of the Attack action in -
stead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra 
attack only once per turn.
Push
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push 
the creature up to 10 feet straight away from your -
self if it is Large or smaller.
Sap
If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature 
has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the 
start of your next turn.
Slow
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal 
damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet un -
til the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit 
more than once by weapons that have this property, 
the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.
Topple
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force 
the creature to make a Constitution saving throw 
(DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the 
attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed 
save, the creature has the Prone condition.
Vex
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal dam -
age to the creature, you have Advantage on your 
next attack roll against that creature before the end 
of your next turn.System Reference Document 5.2.191Weapons

The Armor table lists the game’s main armor. The 
table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well 
as the following details:
Category.  Every type of armor falls into a category: 
Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines 
how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as 
shown in the table).
Armor Class (AC). The table’s Armor Class column 
tells you what your base AC is when you wear a 
type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather 
Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity 
modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.
Strength.  If the table shows a Strength score in the 
Strength column for an armor type, that armor 
reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the 
wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher 
than the listed score.
Stealth.  If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the 
Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has 
Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.Armor Training
Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only 
those with training can use them effectively, as 
explained below. A character’s class and other fea-
tures determine the character’s armor training. 
A monster has training with any armor in its stat 
block.
Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor
If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack 
training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 
Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you 
can’t cast spells.
Shield
You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if 
you have training with it.
One at a Time
A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time 
and wield only one Shield at a time.

Lamp, Lantern, or Torch—or anything else with 
exposed fuel—takes a Bonus Action. Lighting any 
other fire takes 1 minute.
Torch (1 CP)
A Torch burns for 1 hour, casting Bright Light in 
a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 
20 feet. When you take the Attack action, you can 
attack with the Torch, using it as a Simple Melee 
weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1 Fire damage.
Vial (1 GP)
A Vial holds up to 4 ounces.
Waterskin (2 SP)
A Waterskin holds up to 4 pints. If you don’t drink 
sufficient water, you risk dehydration (see “Rules 
Glossary”).
Mounts and Vehicles
A mount can help you move more quickly through 
the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry 
gear that would otherwise slow you down. The 
Mounts and Other Animals table shows each ani -
mal’s carrying capacity. See “Monsters” for the ani -
mals’ stat blocks.
Mounts and Cargo
An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or 
wagon can move weight up to five times its base 
carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehi -
cle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, add 
their carrying capacities together.
Barding
Barding is armor designed for a mount. Any type 
of armor on the Armor table in “Equipment” can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the 
normal cost, and it weighs twice as much.
Saddles
A saddle comes with a bit, a bridle, reins, and any 
other equipment needed to use the saddle. A Mil -
itary Saddle gives Advantage on any ability check 
you make to remain mounted. An Exotic Saddle is 
required for riding an aquatic or a flying mount.

Large Vehicles
The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table pro -
vides statistics for various types of large vehicles. 
The following notes apply.
Speed
A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half 
speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships 
can’t move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats 
and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going 
downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 
3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These 
vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant cur -
rent, but they can be pulled upstream by draft an -
imals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and 
weighs 100 pounds.System Reference Document 5.2.1101Crew
A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a 
crew of skilled hirelings (see “Hirelings” later in 
“Equipment”) to function. The minimum number of 
skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on 
the type of ship, as shown in the table.
Passengers
The table lists the number of Small and Medium 
passengers the ship can accommodate using ham -
mocks. A ship outfitted with private accommoda-
tions can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A pas -
senger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but 
prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private 
cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.
Damage Threshold
If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see “Rules Glos -
sary”), it’s noted in the table.
Ship Repair
Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the 
vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage 
requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and la-
bor. If the repairs are made in a location where sup -
plies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city 
shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.
Lifestyle Expenses
Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a 
fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment 
maintenance, and other necessities.
 At the start of each week or month (GM’s choice), 
choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor, 
Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and 
pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.
 Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the 
GM might take them into account when determining 
risks or how others perceive your character.
Wretched (Free)
You survive via chance and charity. You’re often 
exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping 
outside.Squalid (1 SP per Day)
You spend the bare minimum for your necessities. 
You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and 
opportunistic criminals.
Poor (2 SP per Day)
You spend frugally for your necessities.
Modest (1 GP per Day)
You support yourself at an average level.
Comfortable (2 GP per Day)
You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a 
few luxuries.
Wealthy (4 GP per Day)
You’re accustomed to the finer things in life and 
might have servants.
Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)
You pay for the best and might have a staff that sup -
ports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and 
might encourage you to share it, either legally or 
otherwise.
Food, Drink, and Lodging
The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for 
food and a single night’s lodging. Prices for daily 
lodging and meals are included in your lifestyle’s 
expenses.

Magic Items
Adventures hold the promise—but not a guaran -
tee—of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic 
items are detailed in “Magic Items” later in this doc -
ument. Here’s what you need to know about using 
magic items.
Identifying a Magic Item
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their 
nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspic -
uously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learn -
ing a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic.
 The Identify  spell is the fastest way to reveal an 
item’s properties. Alternatively, you can focus on 
one magic item during a Short Rest while being in 
physical contact with the item. At the end of the 
rest, you learn its properties and how to use them 
(but not any curse the item might bear).
 Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its prop -
erties. The command word to activate a ring might 
be etched inside the band, or a feathered design 
might hint that it’s a Ring of Feather Falling.
 Wearing or experimenting with an item can also 
offer hints about its properties. In the specific case 
of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster 
what a potion does. Other items might require more 
experimentation. For example, if your character 
puts on a Ring of Swimming , the GM might say, “Your 
movement feels strangely fluid.” Perhaps you then 
dive into a river to see what happens. The GM would 
then say you swim unexpectedly well.
Attunement
Some magic items require a creature to form a 
bond—called Attunement—with them before the 
creature can use an item’s magical properties. With -
out becoming attuned to an item that requires At -
tunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits un -
less its description states otherwise. For example, a 
magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the 
benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to 
it, but none of its magical properties.
Attune during a Short Rest
Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short 
Rest focused on only that item while being in physi -
cal contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest 
used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can 
take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), 
meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate 
activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the At -
tunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the 
Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can 
access its full magical capabilities.
No More Than Three Items
You can be attuned to no more than three magic 
items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth 
item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item 
first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than 
one copy of an item. For example, you can’t attune to 
more than one Ring of Protection  at a time.
Ending Attunement
Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer 
satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item 
has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 
hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to System Reference Document 5.2.1103the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement 
by spending another Short Rest focused on the item 
unless the item is cursed.
Wearing and Wielding Items
Using a magic item’s properties might mean wear -
ing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn 
must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on 
feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on

Content: an item ends if you no longer 
satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item 
has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 
hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to System Reference Document 5.2.1103the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement 
by spending another Short Rest focused on the item 
unless the item is cursed.
Wearing and Wielding Items
Using a magic item’s properties might mean wear -
ing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn 
must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on 
feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, 
and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, 
a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about 
the shoulders. A weapon must be held.
 In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be 
worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. 
Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or 
they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.
Multiple Items of the Same Kind
You can’t wear more than one of certain magic 
items. You can’t normally wear more than one pair 
of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair 
of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, 
or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.
Paired Items
Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, 
gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only 
if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a 
character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing  
on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot 
gains no benefit from either.
Crafting Nonmagical Items
To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw ma-
terials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If 
you meet the requirements, you make the item, and 
you can use it or sell it at its normal price.
Tools
The “Tools” section of “Equipment” lists which tools 
are required to make certain items. The GM assigns 
required tools for items not listed there.
 You must use the required tool to make an item 
and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who 
helps you must also have proficiency with it.
Raw Materials
To make an item, you need raw materials worth 
half its purchase cost (round down). For example, 
you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate 
Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines 
whether appropriate raw materials are available.
Time
To determine how many days (working 8 hours a 
day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase 
cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Cross -
bow, which sells for 50 GP.
 If an item requires multiple days, the days needn’t 
be consecutive.
 Characters can combine their efforts to shorten 
the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create 
an item by the number of characters working on it. 
Normally, only one other character can assist you, 
but the GM might allow more assistants.
Brewing Potions of Healing
A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism 
Kit can create a Potion of Healing . Doing so requires 
using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the 
course of 1 day (8 hours of work).
Scribing Spell Scrolls
A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and cre -
ate a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.
Time and Cost
Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money 
based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell 
Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you 
must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple 
days, those days needn’t be consecutive.
Prerequisites for the Scribe
To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the 
Arcana skill or with Calligrapher’s Supplies and 
have the spell prepared on each day of the inscrip -
tion. You must also have at hand any Material com -
ponents required by the spell; if the spell consumes 
its Material components, they are consumed only 
when you complete the scroll. The scroll’s spell uses 
your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
Cantrips
If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the 
scroll works as if the caster were your level.
Spell Scroll Costs
Spell Level  Time  Cost
Cantrip 1 day 15 GP
1 1 day 25 GP

Gaining Spells
Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell 
prepared in your mind or have access to the spell 
from a magic item, such as a Spell Scroll . Your fea-
tures specify which spells you have access to, if any; 
whether you always have certain spells prepared; 
and whether you can change the list of spells you 
have prepared.
Preparing Spells
If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your 
spellcasting feature specifies when you can change 
the list and the number of spells you can change, as 
summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.
Spell Preparation by Class
Class Change When You 
…Number of Spells
Bard Gain a level One
Cleric Finish a Long Rest Any
Druid Finish a Long Rest Any
Paladin Finish a Long Rest One
Ranger Finish a Long Rest One
Sorcerer Gain a level One
Warlock Gain a level One
Wizard Finish a Long Rest Any
Most spellcasting monsters don’t change their lists 
of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them.
Always-Prepared Spells
Certain features might give you a spell that you 
always have prepared. If you also have a list of pre -
pared spells that you can change, a spell that you 
always have prepared doesn’t count against the 
number of spells on that list.
Casting Spells
Each spell description has a series of entries that 
provide the details needed to cast the spell. The fol -
lowing sections explain each of those entries, which 
follow a spell’s name.Spell Level
Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indi -
cated in a spell’s description. A spell’s level is an 
indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple 
spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0. 
The rules for each spellcasting class say when its 
members gain access to spells of certain levels.
Spell Slots
Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only 
a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. 
Spell slots are the main way a spellcaster’s magical 
potential is represented. Each spellcasting class 
gives its members a limited number of spell slots of 
certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard 
has four level 1 spell slots and two level 2 slots.
 When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that 
spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with 
the spell. Imagine a spell slot is a groove of a certain 
size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a high -
er-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any 
size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that’s at 
least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts Magic 
Missile , a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of 
four level 1 slots and has three remaining.
 Finishing a Long Rest restores any expended spell 
slots.
Casting without Slots
There are several ways to cast a spell without 
expending a spell slot:
Cantrips.  A cantrip is cast without a spell slot.
Rituals . Certain spells have the Ritual tag in the 
Casting Time entry. Such a spell can be cast fol -
lowing the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can 
be cast as a Ritual. The Ritual version of a spell 
takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it 
doesn’t expend a spell slot. To cast a spell as a Rit -
ual, a spellcaster must have it prepared.
Special Abilities. Some characters and monsters 
have special abilities that allow them to cast spe -
cific spells without a spell slot. This casting is usu -
ally limited in another way, such as being able to 
cast the spell a limited number of times per day.
Magic Items.  Spell Scrolls  and some other magic 
items contain spells that can be cast without a 
spell slot. The description of such an item speci -
fies how many times a spell can be cast from it.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is 
of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on 
the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a 
Wizard casts Magic Missile  using a level 2 slot, that 
Magic Missile  is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands 
to fill the slot it is put into.System Reference Document 5.2.1105 Some spells, such as Magic Missile  and Cure

Content: many times a spell can be cast from it.
Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is 
of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on 
the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a 
Wizard casts Magic Missile  using a level 2 slot, that 
Magic Missile  is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands 
to fill the slot it is put into.System Reference Document 5.2.1105 Some spells, such as Magic Missile  and Cure 
Wounds , have more powerful effects when cast at a 
higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.
School of Magic
Each spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools 
are listed in the Schools of Magic table. These cate -
gories help describe spells but have no rules of their 
own, although some other rules refer to them.
Schools of Magic
School Typical Effects
Abjuration Prevents or reverses harmful effects
Conjuration Transports creatures or objects
Divination Reveals information
Enchantment Influences minds
Evocation Channels energy to create effects that 
are often destructive
Illusion Deceives the mind or senses
Necromancy Manipulates life and death
Transmutation Transforms creatures or objects
Class Spell Lists
If a spell is on a class’s spell list, the class’s name 
appears in parentheses after the spell’s school of 
magic. Some features add a spell to a character’s 
spell list even if the character isn’t a member of a 
class in the parentheses.
Casting Time
Most spells require the Magic action to cast, but 
some spells require a Bonus Action, a Reaction, or 1 
minute or more. A spell’s Casting Time entry speci -
fies which of those is required.
One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn
On a turn, you can expend only one spell slot to cast 
a spell. This rule means you can’t, for example, cast 
a spell with a spell slot using the Magic action and 
another one using a Bonus Action on the same turn.
Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers
A spell that has a casting time of a Reaction is cast 
in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell’s 
Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting 
time of a Bonus Action are also cast in response to a 
trigger defined in the spell.
Longer Casting Times
Certain spells—including a spell cast as a Rit -
ual—require more time to cast: minutes or even 
hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of 
1 minute or more, you must take the Magic action 
on each of your turns, and you must maintain Con -
centration (see “Rules Glossary”) while you do so. If your Concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you 
don’t expend a spell slot. To cast the spell again, you 
must start over.
Range
A spell’s range indicates how far from the spell -
caster the spell’s effect can originate, and the spell’s 
description specifies which part of the effect is lim -
ited by the range.
 A range usually takes one of the following forms:
Distance.  The range is expressed in feet.
Touch . The spell’s effect originates on something, 
as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must 
touch within their reach.
Self.  The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates 
from them, as specified in the spell.
If a spell has movable effects, they aren’t restricted 
by its range unless the spell’s description says 
otherwise.
Components
A spell’s components are physical requirements the 
spellcaster must meet to cast the spell. Each spell’s 
description indicates whether it requires Verbal 
(V), Somatic (S), or Material (M) components. If the 
spellcaster can’t provide one or more of a spell’s 
components, the spellcaster can’t cast the spell.
Verbal (V)
A Verbal component is the chanting of esoteric 
words that sound like nonsense to the uninitiated. 
The words must be uttered in a normal speaking 
voice. The words themselves aren’t the source of the 
spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of 
sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the 
threads of magic in motion. Thus, a creature who is 
gagged or in an area of magical silence can’t cast a 
spell with a Verbal component.
Somatic (S)
A Somatic component is a forceful gesticulation 
or an intricate set of gestures. A spellcaster must 
use at least one of their hands to perform these 
movements.
Material (M)
A Material component is a particular material used 
in a spell’s casting, as specified in parentheses in 
the Components entry. These materials aren’t con -
sumed by the spell unless the spell’s description 
states otherwise. The spellcaster must have a hand 
free to access them, but it can be the same hand 
used to perform Somatic components, if any.
 If a spell doesn’t consume its materials and 
doesn’t specify a cost for them, a spellcaster can use 
a Component Pouch (see “Equipment”) instead of 
providing the materials specified in the spell, or the System Reference Document 5.2.1106

You can try to identify a non-instantaneous spell by 
its observable effects if its duration is ongoing. To 
identify it, you must take the Study action and suc -
ceed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.spellcaster can substitute a Spellcasting Focus if the 
caster has a feature that allows that substitution. To 
use a Component Pouch, you must have a hand free 
to reach into it, and to use a Spellcasting Focus, you 
must hold it unless its description says otherwise 
(see “Equipment” for descriptions).
Duration
A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell per -
sists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of 
the following forms:
Concentration.  A duration that requires Concen -
tration follows the Concentration rules (see “Rules 
Glossary”).
Instantaneous.  An instantaneous duration means 
the spell’s magic appears only for a moment and 
then disappears.
Time Span.  A duration that provides a time span 
specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, min -
utes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration 
entry might say “1 minute,” meaning the spell 
ends after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span 
spell that you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it 
(no action required) if you don’t have the Incapac -
itated condition.
Effects
The effects of a spell are detailed after its dura-
tion entry. Those details present exactly what the 
spell does, which ignores mundane physical laws; 
any outcomes beyond those effects are under the 
GM’s purview. Whatever the effects, they typically 
deal with targets, saving throws, attack rolls, or all 
three, each of which is detailed below.
Targets
A typical spell requires the caster to pick one or 
more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A 
spell’s description says whether the spell targets 
creatures, objects, or something else.
 A Clear Path to the Target. To target something 
with a spell, a caster must have a clear path to it, so 
it can’t be behind Total Cover.
 Targeting Yourself.  If a spell targets a creature 
of your choice, you can choose yourself unless the 
creature must be Hostile or specifically a creature 
other than you.
 Areas of Effect. Some spells, such as Thunder -
wave , cover an area called an area of effect, which 
is defined in “Rules Glossary.” The area determines 
what the spell targets. The description of a spell 
specifies whether it has an area of effect, which is 
typically one of these shapes: Cone, Cube, Cylinder, 
Emanation, Line, or Sphere. Awareness of Being Targeted. Unless a spell has 
a perceptible effect, a creature doesn’t know it was 
targeted by the spell. An effect like lightning is ob -
vious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt 
to read thoughts, goes unnoticed unless a spell’s 
description says otherwise.
 Invalid Targets.  If you cast a spell on someone 
or something that can’t be affected by it, nothing 
happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to 
cast the spell, the slot is still expended.
 If the spell normally has no effect on a target that 
succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target ap -
pears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even 
though it didn’t attempt one (giving no hint that the 
creature is an invalid target). Otherwise, you per -
ceive that the spell did nothing to the target.
Saving Throws
Many spells specify that a target makes a saving 
throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The 
spell specifies the ability that the target uses for 
the save and what happens on a success or failure. 
Here’s how to calculate the DC for your spells:
Spell save DC = 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier 
+ your Proficiency Bonus 
Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack 
roll to determine whether the spell hits a target. 
Here’s how to calculate the attack modifier for your 
spells:
Spell attack modifier = your spellcasting ability 
modifier + your Proficiency Bonus
Combining Spell Effects
The effects of different spells add together while 
their durations overlap. In contrast, the effects of 
the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine. 
Instead, the most potent effect—such as the high -
est bonus—from those castings applies while their 
durations overlap. The most recent effect applies if 
the castings are equally potent and their durations 
overlap. For example, if two Clerics cast Bless

Components:  V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)
Duration:  8 hours
You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, 
a window, or an area within range that is no larger 
than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters 
the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can 
designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You 
also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:
Audible Alarm.  The alarm produces the sound of 
a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the 
warded area.
Mental Alarm.  You are alerted by a mental ping 
if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This 
ping awakens you if you’re asleep.

statistics change. You can’t appear as a creature of a 
different size, and your basic shape stays the same; 
if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become 
quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can 
take a Magic action to change your appearance in 
this way again.
 Natural Weapons. You grow claws (Slashing), 
fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Blud -
geoning). When you use your Unarmed Strike to 
deal damage with that new growth, it deals 1d6 
damage of the type in parentheses instead of deal -
ing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike, 
and you use your spellcasting ability modifier 
for the attack and damage rolls rather than using 
Strength.

Animal Messenger
Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time:  Action or Ritual
Range:  30 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a morsel of food)
Duration:  24 hours
A Tiny Beast of your choice that you can see within 
range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw, 
or it attempts to deliver a message for you (if the 
target’s Challenge Rating isn’t 0, it automatically 
succeeds). You specify a location you have visited 
and a recipient who matches a general descrip -
tion, such as “a person dressed in the uniform of 
the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a 
pointed hat.” You also communicate a message of 
up to twenty-five words. The Beast travels for the 
duration toward the specified location, covering 
about 25 miles per 24 hours or 50 miles if the Beast 
can fly.
 When the Beast arrives, it delivers your message 
to the creature that you described, mimicking your 
communication. If the Beast doesn’t reach its desti -
nation before the spell ends, the message is lost, and 
the Beast returns to where you cast the spell.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The spell’s dura-
tion increases by 48 hours for each spell slot level 
above  2.
Animal Shapes
Level 8 Transmutation (Druid)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  30 feet
Components:  V, S
Duration:  24 hours
Choose any number of willing creatures that you 
can see within range. Each target shape-shifts into 
a Large or smaller Beast of your choice that has a 
Challenge Rating of 4 or lower. You can choose a dif -
ferent form for each target. On later turns, you can 
take a Magic action to transform the targets again.
 A target’s game statistics are replaced by the 
chosen Beast’s statistics, but the target retains its 
creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; alignment; 
ability to communicate; and Intelligence, Wisdom, 
and Charisma scores. The target’s actions are lim -
ited by the Beast form’s anatomy, and it can’t cast 
spells. The target’s equipment melds into the new 
form, and the target can’t use any of that equipment 
while in that form.
 The target gains a number of Temporary Hit 
Points equal to the Hit Points of the first form into which it shape-shifts. These Temporary Hit Points 
vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The trans -
formation lasts for the duration or until the target 
ends it as a Bonus Action.
Animate Dead
Level 3 Necromancy (Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time:  1 minute
Range:  10 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, 
and a pinch of bone dust)
Duration:  Instantaneous
Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or 
Small Humanoid within range. The target becomes 
an Undead creature: a Skeleton  if you chose bones 
or a Zombie  if you chose a corpse (see “Monsters” 
for the stat blocks).
 On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus Ac -
tion to mentally command any creature you made 
with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of 
you (if you control multiple creatures, you can 
command any of them at the same time, issuing the 
same command to each one). You decide what action 
the creature will take and where it will move on 
its next turn, or you can issue a general command, 
such as to guard a chamber or corridor. If you issue 
no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action 
and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, 
the creature continues to follow it until its task is 
complete.
 The creature is under your control for 24 hours, 
after which it stops obeying any command you’ve 
given it. To maintain control of the creature for an -
other 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the crea-
ture again before the current 24-hour period ends.

Range:  120 feet
Components:  V, S
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 minute
Objects animate at your command. Choose a num -
ber of nonmagical objects within range that aren’t 
being worn or carried, aren’t fixed to a surface, and 
aren’t Gargantuan. The maximum number of objects 
is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; for 
this number, a Medium or smaller target counts as System Reference Document 5.2.1109one object, a Large target counts as two, and a Huge 
target counts as three.
 Each target animates, sprouts legs, and becomes 
a Construct that uses the Animated Object  stat 
block; this creature is under your control until the 
spell ends or until it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. Each 
creature you make with this spell is an ally to you 
and your allies. In combat, it shares your Initiative 
count and takes its turn immediately after yours. 
 Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action 
to mentally command any creature you made with 
this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if 
you control multiple creatures, you can command 
any of them at the same time, issuing the same 
command to each one). If you issue no commands, 
the creature takes the Dodge action and moves only

Antimagic Field
Level 8 Abjuration (Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  Self
Components:  V, S, M (iron filings)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 hour
An aura of antimagic surrounds you in 10-foot Em -
anation. No one can cast spells, take Magic actions, 
or create other magical effects inside the aura, and 
those things can’t target or otherwise affect any -
thing inside it. Magical properties of magic items 
don’t work inside the aura or on anything inside it.
 Areas of effect created by spells or other magic 
can’t extend into the aura, and no one can teleport 
into or out of it or use planar travel there. Portals 
close temporarily while in the aura.
 Ongoing spells, except those cast by an Artifact or 
a deity, are suppressed in the area. While an effect

Level 8 Enchantment (Bard, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time:  1 hour

mines what happens to a creature when it fails that

ment on its turns to get as far away as possible 
from the target, moving by the safest route.
Sympathy.  The creature has the Charmed condi -
tion. The Charmed creature must use its move -
ment on its turns to get as close as possible to the 
target, moving by the safest route. If the creature 
is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can’t 
willingly move away. If the target damages the 
Charmed creature, that creature can make a Animated Object

Duration:  24 hours
With a touch, you place an illusion on a willing crea-
ture or an object that isn’t being worn or carried. A

get appears to spells and magical effects that detect

Astral Projection
Level 9 Necromancy (Cleric, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time:  1 hour

Components:  V, S, M (for each of the spell’s targets, 
one jacinth worth 1,000+ GP and one silver bar worth 
100+ GP, all of which the spell consumes)
Duration:  Until dispelled
You and up to eight willing creatures within range 
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane 
(the spell ends instantly if you are already on that 
plane). Each target’s body is left behind in a state of 
suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condi -
tion, doesn’t need food or air, and doesn’t age.
 A target’s astral form resembles its body in almost 
every way, replicating its game statistics and pos -
sessions. The principal difference is the addition of 
a silvery cord that trails from between the shoulder 
blades of the astral form. The cord fades from view 
after 1 foot. If the cord is cut—which happens only 
when an effect states that it does so—the target’s 
body and astral form both die.
 A target’s astral form can travel through the As -
tral Plane. The moment an astral form leaves that 
plane, the target’s body and possessions travel 
along the silver cord, causing the target to re-enter 
its body on the new plane.
 Any damage or other effects that apply to an as -
tral form have no effect on the target’s body and 
vice versa. If a target’s body or astral form drops to 
0 Hit Points, the spell ends for that target. The spell 
ends for all the targets if you take a Magic action to 
dismiss it. When the spell ends for a target who isn’t dead, 
the target reappears in its body and exits the state 
of suspended animation.

one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “ir -

Level 6 Abjuration (Wizard)
Casting Time:  10 minutes
Range:  Self
Components:  V, S, M (a gem-encrusted statuette of 
yourself worth 1,500+ GP)
Duration:  10 days
Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, 
that has a casting time of an action, and that can 
target you. You cast that spell—called the contin -
gent spell—as part of casting Contingency , expend -
ing spell slots for both, but the contingent spell 
doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect 
when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that 
trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, 
a Contingency  cast with Water Breathing  might stip -
ulate that Water Breathing  comes into effect when 
you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
 The contingent spell takes effect immediately af -
ter the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or 
not you want it to, and then Contingency  ends.
 The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even 
if it can normally target others. You can use only 
one Contingency  spell at a time. If you cast this spell 
again, the effect of another Contingency  spell on you 
ends. Also, Contingency  ends on you if its material 
component is ever not on your person.

Level 2 Evocation (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action

A flame springs from an object that you touch. The 
effect casts Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim 
Light for an additional 20 feet. It looks like a regular 
flame, but it creates no heat and consumes no fuel. 
The flame can be covered or hidden but not smoth -

Control Water
Level 4 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  300 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a mixture of water and dust)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the spell ends, you control any water inside 
an area you choose that is a Cube up to 100 feet on 
a side, using one of the following effects. As a Magic 
action on your later turns, you can repeat the same 
effect or choose a different one.
 Flood. You cause the water level of all standing 
water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If you System Reference Document 5.2.1120choose an area in a large body of water, you instead 
create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side 
of the area to the other and then crashes. Any Huge 
or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried 
with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehi -
cles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of 
capsizing.
 The water level remains elevated until the spell 
ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect 
produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of 
your next turn while the flood effect lasts.
 Part Water. You part water in the area and cre -
ate a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s 
area, and the separated water forms a wall to either 
side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you 
choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills 
in the trench over the course of the next round until 
the normal water level is restored.
 Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the 
area to move in a direction you choose, even if the 
water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in 
other unlikely directions. The water in the area 
moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the 
spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain. 
The water continues to move in the direction you 
chose until the spell ends or you choose a different 
effect.
 Whirlpool. You cause a whirlpool to form in the 
center of the area, which must be at least 50 feet 
square and 25 feet deep. The whirlpool lasts until 
you choose a different effect or the spell ends. The 
whirlpool is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet 
wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature in the 
water and within 25 feet of the whirlpool is pulled 
10 feet toward it. When a creature enters the whirl -
pool for the first time on a turn or ends its turn 
there, it makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed 
save, the creature takes 2d8 Bludgeoning

Content:  Action
Range:  500 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a fractured rock)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a point on the ground that you can see 
within range. For the duration, an intense tremor 
rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle 
centered on that point. The ground there is Difficult 
Terrain.
 When you cast this spell and at the end of each of 
your turns for the duration, each creature on the 
ground in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. 
On a failed save, a creature has the Prone condition, 
and its Concentration is broken.
 You can also cause the effects below.
 Fissures.  A total of 1d6 fissures open in the spell’s 
area at the end of the turn you cast it. You choose 
the fissures’ locations, which can’t be under struc -
tures. Each fissure is 1d10 × 10 feet deep and 10 
feet wide, and it extends from one edge of the spell’s 
area to another edge. A creature in the same space 
as a fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving 
throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves 
moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.
 Structures.  The tremor deals 50 Bludgeoning 
damage to any structure in contact with the ground 
in the area when you cast the spell and at the end of 
each of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure 
drops to 0 Hit Points, it collapses.
 A creature within a distance from a collapsing 
structure equal to half the structure’s height makes 
a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the crea-
ture takes 12d6 Bludgeoning damage, has the Prone 
condition, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a 
DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to es -
cape. On a successful save, the creature takes half as

allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own 
turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other 
actions as normal.
 Disappearance of the Familiar.  When the famil -
iar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears 
after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, 
you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket 
dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. 
As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed,

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of 
force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 
3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space 
of your choice that you can see within range. The 
disk remains for the duration and can hold up to 
500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell 
ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
 The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet 
of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the 
disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of 
you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down 
stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an ele -
vation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the 
disk can’t move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could 
it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

ically because it can’t move around an obstacle to 
follow you), the spell ends.

Duration:  1 day
You create a ward against magical travel that pro -
tects up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a 
height of 30 feet above the floor. For the duration, 
creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals, 
such as those created by the Gate  spell, to enter the 
area. The spell proofs the area against planar travel, 
and therefore prevents creatures from accessing 
the area by way of the Astral Plane, the Ethereal 
Plane, the Feywild, the Shadowfell, or the Plane Shift  
spell.
 In addition, the spell damages types of creatures 
that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or 
more of the following: Aberrations, Celestials, Ele -
mentals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead. When a creature 
of a chosen type enters the spell’s area for the first 
time on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature 
takes 5d10 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your 
choice when you cast this spell).
 You can designate a password when you cast the 
spell. A creature that speaks the password as it en -
ters the area takes no damage from the spell.
 The spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of 
another Forbiddance  spell. If you cast Forbiddance  
every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell 
lasts until it is dispelled, and the Material compo -
nents are consumed on the last casting.System Reference Document 5.2.1134Forcecage
Level 7 Evocation (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  100 feet
Components:  V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500+ GP, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 hour
An immobile, Invisible, Cube-shaped prison com -
posed of magical force springs into existence 
around an area you choose within range. The prison 
can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.
 A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet 
on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars 
spaced 1/2 inch apart. A prison in the shape of a box 
can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid bar -
rier that prevents any matter from passing through 
it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the 
area.
 When you cast the spell, any creature that is com -
pletely inside the cage’s area is trapped. Creatures 
only partially within the area, or those too large to 
fit inside it, are pushed away from the center of the 
area until they are completely outside it.
 A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by non -
magical means. If the creature tries to use telepor -
tation or interplanar travel to leave, it must first 
make a Charisma saving throw. On a successful 
save, the creature can use that magic to exit the 
cage. On a failed save, the creature doesn’t exit the 
cage and wastes the spell or effect. The cage also 
extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal 
travel.
 This spell can’t be dispelled by Dispel Magic .

 In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of move -
ment to automatically escape from nonmagical

your choice within range, where it explodes in a 
60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area 
makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 
Cold damage on failed save or half as much damage

 If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the 
water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet 
square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that 
were swimming on the surface of frozen water are 
trapped in the ice and have the Restrained condi -
tion. A trapped creature can take an action to make 
a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save 
DC to break free.
 You can refrain from firing the globe after com -
pleting the spell’s casting. If you do so, a globe about 
the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears 
in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you 
give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 
40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal 
range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect 
as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the 
globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if 
the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.

you can see within range to a precise location on a 
different plane of existence. The portal is a circular 
opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diam -
eter. You can orient the portal in any direction you 
choose. The portal lasts for the duration, and the 
portal’s destination is visible through it.
 The portal has a front and a back on each plane

 Deities and other planar rulers can prevent por -
tals created by this spell from opening in their pres -
ence or anywhere within their domains.

Level 2 Necromancy (Cleric, Paladin, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action or Ritual
Range:  Touch

consumes)
Duration:  10 days
You touch a corpse or other remains. For the dura-
tion, the target is protected from decay and can’t 
become Undead.
 The spell also effectively extends the time limit on 
raising the target from the dead, since days spent 
under the influence of this spell don’t count against 
the time limit of spells such as Raise Dead .
Giant Insect
Level 4 Conjuration (Druid)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  60 feet
Components:  V, S
Duration:  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You summon a giant centipede, spider, or wasp (cho -
sen when you cast the spell). It manifests in an un -
occupied space you can see within range and uses 
the Giant Insect  stat block. The form you choose 
determines certain details in its stat block. The 
creature disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or 
when the spell ends.
 The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In 
combat, the creature shares your Initiative count, 
but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It 
obeys your verbal commands (no action required by 
you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action 
and uses its movement to avoid danger.System Reference Document 5.2.1136 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. Use the spell 
slot’s level for the spell’s level in the stat block.

Globe of Invulnerability
Level 6 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  SelfComponents:  V, S, M (a glass bead)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 minute
An immobile, shimmering barrier appears in a 10-
foot Emanation around you and remains for the 
duration.
 Any spell of level 5 or lower cast from outside the 
barrier can’t affect anything within it. Such a spell 
can target creatures and objects within the barrier, 
but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the 
area within the barrier is excluded from areas of 
effect created by such spells.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The barrier 
blocks spells of 1 level higher for each spell slot level 
above  6.
Glyph of Warding
Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)
Casting Time:  1 hour
Range:  Touch
Components:  V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 200+ 
GP, which the spell consumes)
Duration:  Until dispelled or triggered
You inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical 
effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a 
table or a section of floor) or within an object that 
can be closed (such as a book or chest) to conceal 
the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger 
than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is 
moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this 
spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends with -
out being triggered.
 The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a 
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your 
spell save DC to notice.
 When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger 
and choose whether it’s an explosive rune or a spell 
glyph, as explained below.
 Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the 
glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed 
on a surface, common triggers include touching or 
stepping on the glyph, removing another object cov -
ering it, or approaching within a certain distance of 
it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common 
triggers include opening that object or seeing the 
glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
 You can refine the trigger so that only creatures 
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph 
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set 
conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, 
such as those who say a certain password.
 Explosive Rune. When triggered, the glyph erupts 
with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere cen -
tered on the glyph. Each creature in the area makes 
a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 Acid, 
Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your System Reference Document 5.2.1137choice when you create the glyph) on a failed save 
or half as much damage on a successful one.
 Spell Glyph.  You can store a prepared spell of 
level 3 or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of 
creating the glyph. The spell must target a single 
creature or an area. The spell being stored has no 
immediate effect when cast in this way.
 When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell 
takes effect. If the spell has a target, it targets the 
creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects 
an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the 
spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful 
objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to 
the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires Con -
centration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage of 
an explosive rune increases by 1d8 for each spell 
slot level above 3. If you create a spell glyph, you can 
store any spell of up to the same level as the spell 
slot you use for the Glyph of Warding.

the guardian for the first time on a turn or starts its

Guards and Wards
Level 6 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)

Duration:  24 hours
You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square 
feet of floor space. The warded area can be up to 
20 feet tall, and you shape it as one 50-foot square, 
one hundred 5-foot squares that are contiguous, or 
twenty-five 10-foot squares that are contiguous.
 When you cast this spell, you can specify individu -
als that are unaffected by the spell’s effects. You can 
also specify a password that, when spoken aloud 
within 5 feet of the warded area, makes the speaker 
immune to its effects.System Reference Document 5.2.1138 The spell creates the effects below within the 
warded area. Dispel Magic  has no effect on Guards 
and Wards  itself, but each of the following effects 
can be dispelled. If all four are dispelled, Guards and 
Wards  ends. If you cast the spell every day for 365 
days on the same area, the spell thereafter lasts un -
til all its effects are dispelled.
 Corridors.  Fog fills all the warded corridors, 
making them Heavily Obscured. In addition, at each 
intersection or branching passage offering a choice 
of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a 
creature other than you believes it is going in the 
opposite direction from the one it chooses.
 Doors.  All doors in the warded area are magically 
locked, as if sealed by the Arcane Lock  spell. In addi -
tion, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion 
to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

tall and is trapped inside an indestructible gem -
stone or a similar object. Light can pass through 
the gemstone (allowing the target to see out and 
other creatures to see in), but nothing else can 
pass through by any means.
Slumber.  The target has the Unconscious condition 
and can’t be awoken.
 Ending the Spell. When you cast the spell, specify 
a trigger that will end it. The trigger can be as sim -
ple or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must 
agree that it has a high likelihood of happening 
within the next decade. The trigger must be an ob -
servable action, such as someone making a partic -
ular offering at the temple of your god, saving your 
true love, or defeating a specific monster.

cast with a level 9 spell slot, targeting either the 
prison or the component used to create it.

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul 
leaves it and enters the container you used for the 
spell’s Material component. While your soul inhab -
its the container, you are aware of your surround -
ings as if you were in the container’s space. You 
can’t move or take Reactions. The only action you

(and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a 
Humanoid’s body.

Humanoid’s body.
 You can attempt to possess any Humanoid within 
100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded 
by a Protection from Evil and Good or Magic Circle  
spell can’t be possessed). The target makes a Cha-
risma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul en -
ters the target’s body, and the target’s soul becomes 
trapped in the container. On a successful save, the 
target resists your efforts to possess it, and you 
can’t attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
 Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. 
Your Hit Points, Hit Point Dice, Strength, Dexterity, 
Constitution, Speed, and senses are replaced by the 
creature’s. You otherwise keep your game statistics.
 Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can per -
ceive from the container using its own senses, but it 
can’t move and it is Incapacitated.
 While possessing a body, you can take a Magic ac -
tion to return from the host body to the container if 
it is within 100 feet of you, returning the host crea-
ture’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while 
you’re in it, the creature dies, and you make a Cha-
risma saving throw against your own spellcasting 
DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is 
within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.
 If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, 
your soul returns to your body. If your body is more 
than 100 feet away from you or if your body is dead, 
you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container 
when it is destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Oth -
erwise, that creature dies.
 When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.
Magic Missile
Level 1 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action

can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 Force

several.

Casting Time:  1 minute or Ritual
Range:  30 feet
Components:  V, S, M (jade dust worth 10+ GP, which 
the spell consumes)
Duration:  Until dispelled
You implant a message within an object in range—a 
message that is uttered when a trigger condition is 
met. Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t 
being worn or carried by another creature. Then 
speak the message, which must be 25 words or 
fewer, though it can be delivered over as long as 10 
minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that 
will trigger the spell to deliver your message.
 When that trigger occurs, a magical mouth ap -
pears on the object and recites the message in your 
voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the ob -
ject you chose has a mouth or something that looks 
like a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), 
the magical mouth appears there, so the words 
appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you 
cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it 
delivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its 
message whenever the trigger occurs.
 The trigger can be as general or as detailed as you 
like, though it must be based on visual or audible 
conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object. 
For example, you could instruct the mouth to speak 
when any creature moves within 30 feet of the ob -
ject or when a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

Magnificent Mansion
Level 7 Conjuration (Bard, Wizard)
Casting Time:  1 minute
Range:  300 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a miniature door worth 15+ GP)
Duration:  24 hours
You conjure a shimmering door in range that lasts 
for the duration. The door leads to an extradimen -
sional dwelling and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. 
You and any creature you designate when you cast 
the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling 
as long as the door remains open. You can open or 
close it (no action required) if you are within 30 feet 
of it. While closed, the door is imperceptible.
 Beyond the door is a magnificent foyer with 
numerous chambers beyond. The dwelling’s atmo -
sphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
 You can create any floor plan you like for the 
dwelling, but it can’t exceed 50 contiguous 10-foot 
Cubes. The place is furnished and decorated as you 
choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine-
course banquet for up to 100 people. Furnishings 
and other objects created by this spell dissipate into 
smoke if removed from it.
 A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends 
all who enter. You determine the appearance of 
these servants and their attire. They are invulner -
able and obey your commands. Each servant can 
perform tasks that a human could perform, but they 
can’t attack or take any action that would directly 
harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch 
things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve 
food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can’t leave 
the dwelling.
 When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left 
inside the extradimensional space are expelled into 
the unoccupied spaces nearest to the entrance.
Major Image
Level 3 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  120 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or 
some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot 
that you can see within range and lasts for the du -
ration. It seems real, including sounds, smells, and 
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but 
it can’t deal damage or cause conditions.
 If you are within range of the illusion, you can 
take a Magic action to cause the image to move to 
any other spot within range. As the image changes 
location, you can alter its appearance so that its 
movements appear natural for the image. For exam -
ple, if you create an image of a creature and move 
it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be 
walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to 
make different sounds at different times, even mak -
ing it carry on a conversation, for example.
 Physical interaction with the image reveals it to 
be an illusion, for things can pass through it. A crea-
ture that takes a Study action to examine the image 
can determine that it is an illusion with a success -
ful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your 
spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for 
what it is, the creature can see through the image, 
and its other sensory qualities become faint to the 
creature.

until dispelled, without requiring Concentration, if 
cast with a level 4+ spell slot.

Duration:  24 hours
You suggest a course of activity—described in no 
more than 25 words—to twelve or fewer creatures 
you can see within range that can hear and under -
stand you. The suggestion must sound achievable 
and not involve anything that would obviously deal 
damage to any of the targets or their allies. For 
example, you could say, “Walk to the village down 
that road, and help the villagers there harvest crops 
until sunset.” Or you could say, “Now is not the time 
for violence. Drop your weapons, and dance! Stop in 
an hour.”
 Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving 
throw or have the Charmed condition for the dura -
tion or until you or your allies deal damage to the 
target. Each Charmed target pursues the suggestion 
to the best of its ability. The suggested activity can 
continue for the entire duration, but if the sug -
gested activity can be completed in a shorter time, 
the spell ends for a target upon completing it.

You banish a creature that you can see within range

there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.
 The target can take a Study action to try to es -
cape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and 
the spell ends. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the 
space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the near -
est unoccupied space.

Level 3 Transmutation (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)
Casting Time:  Action or Ritual
Range:  Touch
Components:  V, S
Duration:  8 hours
You step into a stone object or surface large enough 
to fully contain your body, merging yourself and 
your equipment with the stone for the duration. 
You must touch the stone to do so. Nothing of your 
presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by 
nonmagical senses.
 While merged with the stone, you can’t see what 
occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) 
checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made 
with Disadvantage. You remain aware of the pas -
sage of time and can cast spells on yourself while 
merged in the stone. You can use 5 feet of movement 
to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends 
the spell. You otherwise can’t move.
 Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm 
you, but its partial destruction or a change in its 
shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) 
expels you and deals 6d6 Force damage to you. The 
stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into 
a different substance) expels you and deals 50 Force 
damage to you. If expelled, you move into an unoc -
cupied space closest to where you first entered and 
have the Prone condition.

Content: 5.2.1149You point toward a creature within range and 
whisper a message. The target (and only the target) 
hears the message and can reply in a whisper that 
only you can hear.
 You can cast this spell through solid objects if you 
are familiar with the target and know it is beyond 
the barrier. Magical silence; 1 foot of stone, metal, 
or wood; or a thin sheet of lead blocks the spell.
Meteor Swarm
Level 9 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  1 mile
Components:  V, S
Duration:  Instantaneous
Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four 
different points you can see within range. Each 
creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on 
each of those points makes a Dexterity saving 
throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6 
Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as 
much damage on a successful one. A creature in the 
area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only 
once.
 A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or car -
ried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area, 
and the object starts burning if it’s flammable.
Mind Blank
Level 8 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  Touch
Components:  V, S
Duration:  24 hours
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch 
has Immunity to Psychic damage and the Charmed 
condition. The target is also unaffected by anything 
that would sense its emotions or alignment, read 
its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and 
no spell—not even Wish —can gather information 
about the target, observe it remotely, or control its 
mind.
Mind Spike
Level 2 Divination (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  120 feet
Components:  S
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 hour
You drive a spike of psionic energy into the mind of 
one creature you can see within range. The target 
makes a Wisdom saving throw, taking 3d8 Psychic 
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on 
a successful one. On a failed save, you also always 
know the target’s location until the spell ends, but 
only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the 
target can’t become hidden from you, and if it has 
the Invisible condition, it gains no benefit from that 
condition against you.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage in -
creases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.
Minor Illusion
Illusion Cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  30 feet
Components:  S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration:  1 minute
You create a sound or an image of an object within 
range that lasts for the duration. See the descrip -
tions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends 
if you cast this spell again.
 If a creature takes a Study action to examine the 
sound or image, the creature can determine that it 
is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Inves -
tigation) check against your spell save DC. If a crea-
ture discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion 
becomes faint to the creature.
 Sound.  If you create a sound, its volume can range 
from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, 
someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of 
drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound 
continues unabated throughout the duration, or you 
can make discrete sounds at different times before 
the spell ends.
 Image.  If you create an image of an object—such 
as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it 
must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image 
can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory 
effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it 
to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.
Mirage Arcane
Level 7 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time:  10 minutes
Range:  Sight
Components:  V, S
Duration:  10 days
You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square 
look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other 
sort of terrain. Open fields or a road could be made 
to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other 
rough or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to 
seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle 
slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth 
road.
 Similarly, you can alter the appearance of struc -
tures or add them where none are present. The spell 
doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
 The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and 
olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground System Reference Document 5.2.1150into Difficult Terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise 
impede movement through the area. Any piece 
of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) 
that is removed from the spell’s area disappears 
immediately.
 Creatures with Truesight can see through the illu -
sion to the terrain’s true form; however, all other el -

Mirror Image
Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  Self
Components:  V, S
Duration:  1 minute
Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your 
space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with 
you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s 
impossible to track which image is real.
 Each time a creature hits you with an attack roll 
during the spell’s duration, roll a d6 for each of 
your remaining duplicates. If any of the d6s rolls 
a 3 or higher, one of the duplicates is hit instead of 
you, and the duplicate is destroyed. The duplicates 
otherwise ignore all other damage and effects. The 
spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.
 A creature is unaffected by this spell if it has the 
Blinded condition, Blindsight, or Truesight.
Mislead
Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  Self
Components:  S
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 hour
You gain the Invisible condition at the same time 
that an illusory double of you appears where you 
are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but 
the invisibility ends immediately after you make an 
attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.
 As a Magic action, you can move the illusory dou -
ble up to twice your Speed and make it gesture, 
speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It is 
intangible and invulnerable.
 You can see through its eyes and hear through its 
ears as if you were located where it is.
Misty Step
Level 2 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

Duration: InstantaneousBriefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up 
to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
Modify Memory
Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  30 feet
Components:  V, S
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to reshape another creature’s mem -
ories. One creature that you can see within range 
makes a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting 
the creature, it has Advantage on the save. On a 
failed save, the target has the Charmed condition 
for the duration. While Charmed in this way, the 
target also has the Incapacitated condition and is 
unaware of its surroundings, though it can hear 
you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another 
spell, this spell ends, and no memories are modified.
 While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s 
memory of an event that it experienced within the 
last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 min -
utes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of 
the event, allow the target to recall the event with 
perfect clarity, change its memory of the event’s de -
tails, or create a memory of some other event.
 You must speak to the target to describe how its 
memories are affected, and it must be able to under -
stand your language for the modified memories to 
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of 
your description. If the spell ends before you finish 
describing the modified memories, the creature’s 
memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified 
memories take hold when the spell ends.
 A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect 
how a creature behaves, particularly if the mem -
ory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, 
alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, 
such as a false memory of how much the creature 
enjoyed swimming in acid, is dismissed as a bad 
dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too 
nonsensical to affect a creature.
 A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration  spell cast 
on the target restores the creature’s true memory.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. You can alter the 
target’s memories of an event that took place up to 
7 days ago (level 6 spell slot), 30 days ago (level 7 
spell slot), 365 days ago (level 8 spell slot), or any 
time in the creature’s past (level 9 spell slot).

Level 2 Evocation (Druid)
Casting Time:  Action

Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 minuteSystem Reference Document 5.2.1151A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 
5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a 
point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light 
fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on 
later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.
 When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it 
makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, 
a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the 
creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Poly -
morph  spell, for example), it reverts to its true form 
and can’t shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. 
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much 
damage only. A creature also makes this save when 
the spell’s area moves into its space and when it 
enters the spell’s area or ends its turn there. A crea-
ture makes this save only once per turn.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage in -
creases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.
Move Earth
Level 6 Transmutation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  120 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a miniature shovel)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 2 hours
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on 
a side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or 
clay in the area in any manner you choose for the 
duration. You can raise or lower the area’s eleva-
tion, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, 
or form a pillar. The extent of any such changes 
can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. For 
example, if you affect a 40-foot square, you can 
create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the 
square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up 
to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for 
these changes to complete. Because the terrain’s 
transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area 
can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s 
movement.
 At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concen -
trating on the spell, you can choose a new area of 
terrain to affect within range.
 This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone 
construction. Rocks and structures shift to accom -
modate the new terrain. If the way you shape the 
terrain would make a structure unstable, it might 
collapse.
 Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant 
growth. The moved earth carries any plants along 
with it.

Level 3 Abjuration (Bard, Ranger, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  TouchComponents:  V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 
25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
Duration:  8 hours
For the duration, you hide a target that you touch 
from Divination spells. The target can be a willing 
creature, or it can be a place or an object no larger 
than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t 
be targeted by any Divination spell or perceived 
through magical scrying sensors.
Passwall
Level 5 Transmutation (Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  30 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)
Duration:  1 hour
A passage appears at a point that you can see on a 
wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, 
ceiling, or floor) within range and lasts for the dura-
tion. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5 
feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage 
creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.
 When the opening disappears, any creatures or 
objects still in the passage created by the spell are 
safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the 
surface on which you cast the spell.
Pass without Trace
Level 2 Abjuration (Druid, Ranger)

Phantasmal Force
Level 2 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  60 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to craft an illusion in the mind of a 
creature you can see within range. The target 
makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed 
save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or 
other phenomenon that is no larger than a 10-foot 
Cube and that is perceivable only to the target for 
the duration. The phantasm includes sound, tem-
perature, and other stimuli.
 The target can take a Study action to examine the 
phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check 
against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, System Reference Document 5.2.1152the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, 
and the spell ends.
 While affected by the spell, the target treats the 
phantasm as if it were real and rationalizes any il -
logical outcomes from interacting with it. For exam -
ple, if the target steps through a phantasmal bridge 
and survives the fall, it believes the bridge exists 
and something else caused it to fall.
 An affected target can even take damage from 
the illusion if the phantasm represents a dangerous 
creature or hazard. On each of your turns, such a 
phantasm can deal 2d8 Psychic damage to the tar -
get if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of 
the phantasm. The target perceives the damage as a 
type appropriate to the illusion.
Phantasmal Killer
Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  120 feet
Components:  V, S
Duration:  Concentration, up to 1 minute
You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can 
see within range and create an illusion of its deep -
est fears, visible only to that creature. The target 
makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the 
target takes 4d10 Psychic damage and has Disad -
vantage on ability checks and attack rolls for the 
duration. On a successful save, the target takes half 
as much damage, and the spell ends.
 For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom sav -
ing throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed 
save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a suc -
cessful save, the spell ends.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage in -

Phantom Steed
Level 3 Illusion (Wizard)

Duration:  1 hour
A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on 
the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice 
within range. You decide the creature’s appearance, 
and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any 
of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a 
puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away 
from the steed.
 For the duration, you or a creature you choose 
can ride the steed. The steed uses the Riding Horse 
stat block (see “Monsters”), except it has a Speed of 
100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When 
the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the 
rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if 
the steed takes any damage.Planar Ally
Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)
Casting Time:  10 minutes
Range:  60 feet
Components:  V, S
Duration:  Instantaneous
You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The be -
ing must be known to you: a god, a demon prince, or 
some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends 
a Celestial, an Elemental, or a Fiend loyal to it to aid 
you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied 
space within range. If you know a specific creature’s 
name, you can speak that name when you cast this 
spell to request that creature, though you might get 
a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).
 When the creature appears, it is under no com -
pulsion to behave a particular way. You can ask it 
to perform a service in exchange for payment, but 
it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could 
range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help 
us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or 
protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You 
must be able to communicate with the creature to 
bargain for its services.
 Payment can take a variety of forms. A Celestial

mand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some 
creatures might exchange their service for a quest 
undertaken by you.
 A task that can be measured in minutes requires a 
payment worth 100 GP per minute. A task measured 
in hours requires 1,000 GP per hour. And a task 
measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 
GP per day. The GM can adjust these payments 
based on the circumstances under which you cast 
the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature’s 
ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. 
Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the 
suggested payment, while especially dangerous 
tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely 
accept tasks that seem suicidal.
 After the creature completes the task, or when the 
agreed-upon duration of service expires, the crea -

to you if possible. If you are unable to agree on a

Duration:  24 hoursSystem Reference Document 5.2.1153You attempt to bind a Celestial, an Elemental, a 
Fey, or a Fiend to your service. The creature must 
be within range for the entire casting of the spell. 
(Typically, the creature is first summoned into the 
center of the inverted version of the Magic Circle  
spell to trap it while this spell is cast.) At the com -
pletion of the casting, the target must succeed on 
a Charisma saving throw or be bound to serve you 
for the duration. If the creature was summoned or 
created by another spell, that spell’s duration is ex -
tended to match the duration of this spell.
 A bound creature must follow your commands 
to the best of its ability. You might command the 
creature to accompany you on an adventure, to 
guard a location, or to deliver a message. If the 
creature is Hostile, it strives to twist your com -
mands to achieve its own objectives. If the creature 
carries out your commands completely before the 
spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you 
are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a 
different plane, it returns to the place where you 
bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point within 
range. Alternatively, you shape the wall into a globe 
up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point within 
range. The wall lasts for the duration. If you posi -
tion the wall in a space occupied by a creature, the 
spell ends instantly without effect.
 The wall sheds Bright Light within 100 feet and 
Dim Light for an additional 100 feet. You and crea-
tures you designate when you cast the spell can 
pass through and be near the wall without harm. If 
another creature that can see the wall moves within 
20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature 
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or 
have the Blinded condition for 1 minute.
 The wall consists of seven layers, each with a 
different color. When a creature reaches into or 
passes through the wall, it does so one layer at a 
time through all the layers. Each layer forces the 
creature to make a Dexterity saving throw or be af -
fected by that layer’s properties as described in the 
Prismatic Layers table.
 The wall, which has AC 10, can be destroyed one 
layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. If a layer is destroyed, it is 
gone for the duration. Antimagic Field  has no effect 
on the wall, and Dispel Magic  can affect only the vio -
let layer.

the creature’s Speed. Similarly, the globe can be 
picked up and moved by other creatures.

just as they would during a downward fall. If an af -
fected creature or object reaches the Cylinder’s top 
without striking anything, it hovers there for the 
duration. When the spell ends, affected objects and 
creatures fall downward.

pearance of the targets’ bodies and equipment.

appearance must have the same basic arrangement 
of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion System Reference Document 5.2.1161is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the 
duration.
 The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up 
to physical inspection. For example, if you use this 
spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass 
through the hat.

manner immediately. The spell enables targets to 
understand the meaning of your message.
 You can send the message across any distance and 
even to other planes of existence, but if the target 
is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent 
chance that the message doesn’t arrive. You know if 
the delivery fails.

You create the image of an object, a creature, or 
some other visible phenomenon that is no larger 
than a 15-foot Cube. The image appears at a spot 
within range and lasts for the duration. The image 
is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, 
smell, or other sensory effects.
 As a Magic action, you can cause the image 
to move to any spot within range. As the image 
changes location, you can alter its appearance so 
that its movements appear natural for the image. 
For example, if you create an image of a creature 
and move it, you can alter the image so that it ap -
pears to be walking.
 Physical interaction with the image reveals it to 
be an illusion, since things can pass through it. A 
creature that takes a Study action to examine the 
image can determine that it is an illusion with a 
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against 
your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illu -
sion for what it is, the creature can see through the 
image.
Simulacrum
Level 7 Illusion (Wizard)
Casting Time:  12 hours
Range:  Touch
Components:  V, S, M (powdered ruby worth 1,500+ GP, 
which the spell consumes)
Duration:  Until dispelledSystem Reference Document 5.2.1163You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid 
that is within 10 feet of you for the entire casting of 
the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the 
creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same 
size as that creature, and the pile turns into the 
simulacrum, which is a creature. It uses the game 
statistics of the original creature at the time of cast -
ing, except it is a Construct, its Hit Point maximum 
is half as much, and it can’t cast this spell.
 The simulacrum is Friendly to you and creatures 
you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on 
your turn in combat. The simulacrum can’t gain lev -
els, and it can’t take Short or Long Rests.
 If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way 
to restore its Hit Points is to repair it as you take a 
Long Rest, during which you expend components 
worth 100 GP per Hit Point restored. The simula-
crum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair.
 The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 Hit Points, 
at which point it reverts to snow and melts away. If 
you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you cre -
ated with this spell is instantly destroyed.

Sphere centered on a point within range must suc -
ceed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Inca-
pacitated condition until the end of its next turn, 
at which point it must repeat the save. If the target 
fails the second save, the target has the Unconscious 
condition for the duration. The spell ends on a tar -
get if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it 
takes an action to shake it out of the spell’s effect.

within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the 
target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 damage of a 
type you choose: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, 
Psychic, or Thunder.
 If you roll an 8 on a d8 for this spell, you can roll 
another d8, and add it to the damage. When you cast 
this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you 
can add to the spell’s damage equals your spellcast -
ing ability modifier.
 Cantrip Upgrade. The damage increases by 1d8

For the duration, you can comprehend and verbally

nearby locations and monsters, including whatever 
it has perceived within the past day.

Duration:  10 minutes
You grant the semblance of life to a corpse of your 
choice within range, allowing it to answer ques -
tions you pose. The corpse must have a mouth, and 
this spell fails if the deceased creature was Undead 
when it died. The spell also fails if the corpse was 
the target of this spell within the past 10 days.
 Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to 
five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew 
in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are 
usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse 
is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if 
you are antagonistic toward it or it recognizes you 
as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s 
soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the 
corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t compre -
hend anything that has happened since it died, and 
can’t speculate about future events.

ing information about creatures that have passed, 
weather, and other circumstances.
 You can also turn Difficult Terrain caused by plant 
growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into 
ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present 
into Difficult Terrain that lasts for the duration.
 The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot them -
selves and move about, but they can move their 
branches, tendrils, and stalks for you.
 If a Plant creature is in the area, you can commu -
nicate with it as if you shared a common language.

Line. Each creature in the Line makes a Constitution

create a new Line of radiance.
 For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance 
shines above you. It sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot

Symbol
Level 7 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Wizard)
Casting Time:  1 minute
Range:  Touch
Components:  V, S, M (powdered diamond worth 1,000+ 
GP, which the spell consumes)
Duration:  Until dispelled or triggered
You inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface 
(such as a section of floor or wall) or within an ob -
ject that can be closed (such as a book or chest). The 
glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in 
diameter. If you choose an object, it must remain in 
place; if it is moved more than 10 feet from where 
you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell 
ends without being triggered.
 The glyph is nearly imperceptible and requires a 
successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your 
spell save DC to notice.
 When you inscribe the glyph, you set its trigger 
and choose which effect the symbol bears: Death, 
Discord, Fear, Pain, Sleep, or Stunning. Each one is 
explained below.
 Set the Trigger. You decide what triggers the 
glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed 
on a surface, common triggers include touching or 
stepping on the glyph, removing another object cov -
ering it, or approaching within a certain distance of 
it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, common 
triggers include opening that object or seeing the 
glyph.
 You can refine the trigger so that only creatures 
of certain types activate it (for example, the glyph 
could be set to affect Aberrations). You can also set 
conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, 
such as those who say a certain password.
 Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 
60-foot-radius Sphere with Dim Light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each 
creature in the Sphere when the glyph activates is 
targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the 
Sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn 
there. A creature is targeted only once per turn.
 Death.  Each target makes a Constitution saving 
throw, taking 10d10 Necrotic damage on a failed 
save or half as much damage on a successful save.
 Discord.  Each target makes a Wisdom saving 
throw. On a failed save, a target argues with other 
creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is inca-
pable of meaningful communication and has Disad -
vantage on

You gain the ability to move or manipulate crea -
tures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell 
and as a Magic action on your later turns before the 
spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature 
or object that you can see within range, causing the 
appropriate effect below. You can affect the same 
target round after round or choose a new one at any 
time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no 
longer affected by the spell.
 Creature.  You can try to move a Huge or smaller 
creature. The target must succeed on a Strength 
saving throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any 
direction within the spell’s range. Until the end of

dition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended 
there. It falls at the end of your next turn unless you 
use this option on it again and it fails the save.
 Object. You can try to move a Huge or smaller 
object. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you 
automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction 
within the spell’s range.System Reference Document 5.2.1168 If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that 
creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, 
or you pull the object away and move it up to 30 feet 
in any direction within the spell’s range.

come table and the explanations after it.

 Mishap.  The spell’s unpredictable magic results in 
a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the 
target object) takes 3d10 Force damage, and the GM 
rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (mul -
tiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
 Similar Area. You and your group (or the target 
object) appear in a different area that’s visually or 
thematically similar to the target area. You appear 
in the closest similar place. If you are heading for 
your home laboratory, for example, you might ap -
pear in another person’s laboratory in the same city.
 Off Target.  You and your group (or the target ob -
ject) appear 2d12 miles away from the destination 
in a random direction. Roll 1d8 for the direction: 1, 
east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, 
northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast.

As you cast the spell, you draw a 5-foot-radius circle 
on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your 
location to a permanent teleportation circle of your 
choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is 
on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmer -
ing portal opens within the circle you drew and 
remains open until the end of your next turn. Any 
creature that enters the portal instantly appears 
within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the near -
est unoccupied space if that space is occupied.System Reference Document 5.2.1169 Many major temples, guildhalls, and other import -
ant places have permanent teleportation circles. 
Each circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a 
string of runes arranged in a particular pattern. 
 When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, 
you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations 
on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You 
might learn additional sigil sequences during your 
adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to 
memory after studying it for 1 minute.
 You can create a permanent teleportation circle 
by casting this spell in the same location every day 
for 365 days.

 Creatures and objects within the Emanation

Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you 
can see within range. The creature shape-shifts into 
a different creature or a nonmagical object, or the 
object shape-shifts into a creature (the object must 
be neither worn nor carried). The transformation 
lasts for the duration or until the target dies or is 
destroyed, but if you maintain Concentration on 
this spell for the full duration, the spell lasts until 
dispelled. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving 
throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.
 Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature 
into another kind of creature, the new form can be 
any kind you choose that has a Challenge Rating 
equal to or less than the target’s Challenge Rating 
or level. The target’s game statistics are replaced by 
the stat block of the new form, but it retains its Hit 
Points, Hit Point Dice, alignment, and personality.
 The target gains a number of Temporary Hit 
Points equal to the Hit Points of the new form. 
These Temporary Hit Points vanish if any remain 
when the spell ends.
 The target is limited in the actions it can perform 
by the anatomy of its new form, and it can’t speak or 
cast spells.
 The target’s gear melds into the new form. The 
creature can’t use or otherwise benefit from any of 
that equipment.
 Object into Creature. You can turn an object into 
any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size 
is no larger than the object’s size and the creature 
has a Challenge Rating of 9 or lower. The creature is 
Friendly to you and your allies. In combat, it takes 
its turns immediately after yours, and it obeys your 
commands.
 If the spell lasts more than an hour, you no longer 
control the creature. It might remain Friendly to 
you, depending on how you have treated it.
 Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into 
an object, it transforms along with whatever it is 
wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the 
object’s size is no larger than the creature’s size. The 
creature’s statistics become those of the object, and 
the creature has no memory of time spent in this 
form after the spell ends and it returns to normal.

diant damage or the weapon’s normal damage type 
(your choice).

attack with the weapon used in the spell’s casting. 
The attack uses your spellcasting ability for the at -
tack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or 
Dexterity. If the attack deals damage, it can be Ra-
diant damage or the weapon’s normal damage type 
(your choice).
 Cantrip Upgrade. Whether you deal Radiant dam -
age or the weapon’s normal damage type, the attack 
deals extra Radiant damage when you reach levels 5

Tsunami
Level 8 Conjuration (Druid)
Casting Time:  1 minute
Range:  1 mile
Components:  V, S
Duration:  Concentration, up to 6 rounds
A wall of water springs into existence at a point you 
choose within range. You can make the wall up to 
300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The 
wall lasts for the duration.
 When the wall appears, each creature in its area 
makes a Strength saving throw, taking 6d10 Blud -
geoning damage on a failed save or half as much 
damage on a successful one.
 At the start of each of your turns after the wall 
appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, 
moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller 
creature inside the wall or whose space the wall 
enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength 
saving throw or take 5d10 Bludgeoning damage. A 
creature can take this damage only once per round. 
At the end of the turn, the wall’s height is reduced 
by 50 feet, and the damage the wall deals on later rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 
feet in height, the spell ends.
 A creature caught in the wall can move by swim -
ming. Because of the wave’s force, though, the crea-
ture must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check 
against your spell save DC to move at all. If it fails 
the check, it can’t move. A creature that moves out 
of the wall falls to the ground.

command until the spell ends. The servant springs 
into existence in an unoccupied space on the 
ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 Hit Point, and a 
Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 Hit 
Points, the spell ends.
 Once on each of your turns as a Bonus Action, you 
can mentally command the servant to move up to 
15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can 
perform simple tasks that a human could do, such as 
fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, 
lighting fires, serving food, and pouring drinks. 
Once you give the command, the servant performs 
the task to the best of its ability until it completes 
the task, then waits for your next command.
 If you command the servant to perform a task that 
would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the 
spell ends.

damage, and you regain Hit Points equal to half the 
amount of Necrotic damage dealt.
 Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again 
on each of your turns as a Magic action, targeting 
the same creature or a different one.

Level 5 Evocation (Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  120 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a shard of glass)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
An Invisible wall of force springs into existence at 
a point you choose within range. The wall appears 
in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or 
vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating 
or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a 
hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up 
to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up 
of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must 
be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the 
wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. If 
the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it ap -
pears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall 
(you choose which side).
 Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It 
is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by

Wall of Ice
Level 6 Evocation (Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  120 feet

or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can 
shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square 
panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another 
panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts

it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the 
wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity 
saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on a failed 
save or half as much damage on a successful one.
 The wall is an object that can be damaged and 
thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 Hit Points per 
10-foot section, and it has Immunity to Cold, Poi -
son, and Psychic damage and Vulnerability to Fire 
damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 Hit 
Points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid 
air in the space the wall occupied.
 A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air 
for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution 
saving throw, taking 5d6 Cold damage on a failed 
save or half as much damage on a successful one.System Reference Document 5.2.1173 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage the

Wall of Stone
Level 5 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  120 feet
Components:  V, S, M (a cube of granite)
Duration:  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into exis -
tence at a point you choose within range. The wall 
is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-
10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with 
another panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-
by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
 If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when 
it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the 
wall (you choose which side). If a creature would 
be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall 
and another solid surface), that creature can make 
a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its 
Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no lon -
ger enclosed by the wall.
 The wall can have any shape you desire, though it 
can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. 
The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on a firm 
foundation. It must, however, merge with and be 
solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can 
use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
 If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, 
you must halve the size of each panel to create sup -
ports. You can crudely shape the wall to create bat -
tlements and the like.
 The wall is an object made of stone that can be 
damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 
and 30 Hit Points per inch of thickness, and it has 
Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. Reducing 
a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might cause 
connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.
 If you maintain your Concentration on this spell 
for its full duration, the wall becomes permanent 
and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disap -
pears when the spell ends.
Wall of Thorns

Casting Time:  Action
Range:  120 feet

Duration:  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with 
needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range 
on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You 
choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot 
diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. 
The wall blocks line of sight.
 When the wall appears, each creature in its area 
makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d8 Pierc -
ing damage on a failed save or half as much damage 
on a successful one.
 A creature can move through the wall, albeit 
slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature 
moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of 
movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature 
enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn 
there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 7d8 Slashing damage on a failed save or half 
as much damage on a successful one. A creature 
makes this save only once per turn.
 Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. Both types of 
damage increase by 1d8 for each spell slot level 
above 6.

Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same 
amount of damage.

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid 
surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, 
or lava—as if it were harmless solid ground (crea-

choice within range gain this ability for the duration.

Casting Time: Action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point 
within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for 
the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain, and the 
area within them is Lightly Obscured.
 If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid 
masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across 
a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, 
and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. 
Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 
feet.
 The first time a creature enters the webs on a 
turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a 
Dexterity saving throw or have the Restrained con -
dition while in the webs or until it breaks free.
 A creature Restrained by the webs can take an 
action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against 
your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer 
Restrained.
 The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs 
exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4

the fire.

Sphere centered on a point within range makes a 
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target 
takes 10d10 Psychic damage and has the Frightened 
condition for the duration. On a successful save, a 
target takes half as much damage only. A Frightened target makes a Wisdom saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed

can hover; it has Immunity to the Prone condition; 
and it has Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and 
Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take 
in this form are the Dash action or a Magic action to 
begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 
1 minute, during which the target has the Stunned 
condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert 
to cloud form, which also requires a Magic action 
followed by a 1-minute transformation.
 If a target is in cloud form and flying when the ef -
fect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 
1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can’t

Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By 
simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.
 The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other 
spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you 
don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that 
spell, including costly components. The spell simply 
takes effect.
 Alternatively, you can create one of the following 
effects of your choice:
Object Creation.  You create one object of up to 
25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item. The 
object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimen -

twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit 
Points, and you end all effects on them listed in 
the Greater Restoration  spell.
Resistance.  You grant up to ten creatures that you 
can see Resistance to one damage type that you 
choose. This Resistance is permanent.
Spell Immunity.  You grant up to ten creatures you 
can see immunity to a single spell or other magi -
cal effect for 8 hours.
Sudden Learning.  You replace one of your feats with 
another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all 
the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of 
the new one. You can’t replace a feat that is a pre -
requisite for any of your other feats or features.
Roll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing 
a reroll of any die roll made within the last round 
(including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to 
accommodate the new result. For example, a Wish 
spell could undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a 
foe’s Critical Hit. You can force the reroll to be made 
with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you choose 
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
Reshape Reality.  You may wish for something not 
included in any of the other effects. To do so, state 
your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The 
GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in 
such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater 
the likelihood that something goes wrong. This 
spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might 
be achieved only in part, or you might suffer an 
unforeseen consequence as a result of how you 
worded the wish. For example, wishing that a 
villain were dead might propel you forward in 
time to a period when that villain is no longer 
alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a Legendary magic item or 
an Artifact might instantly transport you to the 
presence of the item’s current owner. If your wish 
is granted and its effects have consequences for a 
whole community, region, or world, you are likely 
to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect 
a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly in -
tervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft 
the wish in a particular way. If your wish would 
undo the multiverse itself, your wish fails.
The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect 
other than duplicating another spell weakens you. 
After enduring that stress, each time you cast a 
spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take

Content: current owner. If your wish 
is granted and its effects have consequences for a 
whole community, region, or world, you are likely 
to attract powerful foes. If your wish would affect 
a god, the god’s divine servants might instantly in -
tervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft 
the wish in a particular way. If your wish would 
undo the multiverse itself, your wish fails.
The stress of casting Wish to produce any effect 
other than duplicating another spell weakens you. 
After enduring that stress, each time you cast a 
spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 
Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage 
can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addi -
tion, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. 
For each of those days that you spend resting and 
doing nothing more than light activity, your remain -
ing recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there 
is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast 
Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.
Word of Recall
Level 6 Conjuration (Cleric)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  5 feet
Components:  V
Duration:  Instantaneous
You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet 
of you instantly teleport to a previously designated 
sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with 
you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the 
spot you designated when you prepared your sanc -
tuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first 
preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no effect.
 You must designate a location, such as a temple, as 
a sanctuary by casting this spell there.
Zone of Truth
Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)
Casting Time:  Action
Range:  60 feet
Components:  V, S
Duration:  10 minutes
You create a magical zone that guards against de -
ception in a 15-foot-radius Sphere centered on a 
point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature 
that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a 
turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma sav -
ing throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a 
deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether 
a creature succeeds or fails on this save.
 An affected creature is aware of the spell and 
can avoid answering questions to which it would 
normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be 
evasive yet must be truthful. System Reference Document 5.2.1176Rules Glossary
Glossary Conventions
The glossary uses the following conventions:
Tags in Brackets. Some entries have a tag in brack -
ets after the entry’s name, as in “Attack [Action].” 
A tag—Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition, 
or Hazard—indicates that a rule is part of a family 
of rules. The tags also have glossary entries.
“You.”  The game’s rules—in this glossary and else -
where—often talk about something happening 
to you in the game world. That “you” refers to 
the creature or object that the rule applies to in a 
particular moment of play. For example, the “you” 
in the Prone condition is a creature that currently 
has that condition.
“See Also.”  Some glossary entries include a See also  
section that points to other entries in the glossary, 
to other parts of this document, or both.
No Obsolete Terms. The glossary contains defini -
tions of current rules terms only. If you’re looking 
for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edi -
tion rules, consult the index.

Point(s)Rules Definitions
Here are definitions of various rules.
Ability Check
An ability check is a D20 Test that represents using 
one of the six abilities—or a specific skill associated 
with an ability—to overcome a challenge. See also  
“Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests” and “Proficiency”).
Ability Score and Modifier
A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dex -
terity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and 
Charisma—each of which has a corresponding mod -
ifier. Add the modifier when you make a D20 Test 
with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks 
you to do so. See also  “Playing the Game” (“The Six 
Abilities”).
Action
On your turn, you can take one action. Choose which 
action to take from those below or from the special 
actions provided by your features. See also  “Playing 
the Game” (“Actions”). These actions are defined 
elsewhere in this glossary:
Attack
Dash
DisengageDodge
Help
HideInfluence
Magic
ReadySearch
Study
Utilize
Advantage
If you have Advantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s, 
and use the higher roll. A roll can’t be affected by 
more than one Advantage, and Advantage and Dis -
advantage on the same roll cancel each other.

If you have Advantage on a D20 Test, roll two d20s, 
and use the higher roll. A roll can’t be affected by 
more than one Advantage, and Advantage and Dis -
advantage on the same roll cancel each other. See 
also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Adventure
An adventure is a series of encounters. A 
story emerges through playing them. See also  
“Encounter.”
Alignment
A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical 
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of 
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or 
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward 
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). These factors al -
low for nine possible combinations, such as Lawful 
Good and Neutral Evil. See also  “Character Creation” 
(“Create Your Character”).
Ally
A creature is your ally if it is a member of your ad -
venturing party, your friend, on your side in combat, 
or a creature that the rules or the GM designates as 
your ally.
System Reference Document 5.2.1177Area of Effect
The descriptions of many spells and other features 
specify that they have an area of effect, which typ -
ically has one of six shapes. These shapes are de -
fined elsewhere in this glossary:
Cone
CubeCylinder
EmanationLine
Sphere
An area of effect has a point of origin, a location 
from which the effect’s energy erupts. The rules for 
each shape specify how to position its point of ori -
gin. If all straight lines extending from the point of 
origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked, 
that location isn’t included in the area of effect. 
To block a line, an obstruction must provide Total 
Cover. See also  “Cover.”
 If the creator of an area of effect places it at an 
unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall—
is between the creator and that point, the point 
of origin comes into being on the near side of the 
obstruction.
Armor Class
An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an 
attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a 
target.
 Your base AC calculation is 10 plus your Dexterity 
modifier. If a rule gives you another base AC calcula-
tion, you choose which calculation to use; you can’t 
use more than one. See also  “Attack Roll.”
Armor Training
Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain 
category without the following drawbacks. If you 
wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack train -
ing with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test 
that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t 
cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with 
it, you don’t gain its AC bonus. See also  “Disadvan -
tage” and “Equipment” (“Armor”).
Attack [Action]
When you take the Attack action, you can make one 
attack roll with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
 Equipping and Unequipping Weapons.  You can 
either equip or unequip one weapon when you make 
an attack as part of this action. You do so either 
before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon 
before an attack, you don’t need to use it for that at -
tack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from 
a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon in -
cludes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.
 Moving between Attacks. If you move on your 
turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that 
gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack 
action, you can use some or all of that movement to 
move between those attacks.Attack Roll
An attack roll is a D20 Test that represents making 
an attack with a weapon, an Unarmed Strike, or a 
spell. See also  “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Attitude
A monster has a starting attitude toward a player 
character: Friendly, Hostile, or Indifferent. See also  
“Friendly,” “Hostile,” “Indifferent,” and “Influence.”
Attunement
Some magic items require a creature to form a 
bond—called Attunement—with them before the 
creature can use an item’s magical properties. A 
creature can have Attunement with no more than 
three magic items at a time. See also  “Equipment” 
(“Magic Items”).
Blinded [Condition]
While you have the Blinded condition, you experi -
ence the following effects.
 Can’t See.  You can’t see and automatically fail any 
ability check that requires sight.
 Attacks Affected.  Attack rolls against you have 
Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.
Blindsight
If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific 
range without relying on physical sight. Within that 
range, you can see anything that isn’t behind Total 
Cover even if you have the Blinded condition or are 
in Darkness. Moreover,

Content: can have Attunement with no more than 
three magic items at a time. See also  “Equipment” 
(“Magic Items”).
Blinded [Condition]
While you have the Blinded condition, you experi -
ence the following effects.
 Can’t See.  You can’t see and automatically fail any 
ability check that requires sight.
 Attacks Affected.  Attack rolls against you have 
Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.
Blindsight
If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific 
range without relying on physical sight. Within that 
range, you can see anything that isn’t behind Total 
Cover even if you have the Blinded condition or are 
in Darkness. Moreover, in that range, you can see 
something that has the Invisible condition.
Bloodied
A creature is Bloodied while it has half its Hit Points 
or fewer remaining.
Bonus Action
A Bonus Action is a special action that you can take 
on the same turn that you take an action. You can’t 
take more than one Bonus Action on a turn, and you 
have a Bonus Action to take only if a rule explicitly 
says so. See also  “Playing the Game” (“Actions”).
Breaking Objects
Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some 
spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceed -
ingly fragile, the GM may allow a creature to break 
it automatically with the Attack or Utilize action.
 Armor Class.  The Object Armor Class table sug -
gests ACs for various substances.System Reference Document 5.2.1178Object Armor Class
AC Substance AC Substance
11Cloth, paper, rope 19 Iron, steel
13Crystal, glass, ice 21 Mithral
15Wood 23 Adamantine
17Stone
 Hit Points. An object is destroyed when it has 0 
Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit 
Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large 
or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargan -
tuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, 
and track each section’s Hit Points separately. The 
GM determines whether destroying part of an ob -
ject causes the whole thing to collapse.
Object Hit Points
Size Fragile Resilient
Tiny (bottle, lock) 2 (1d4) 5 (2d4)
Small (chest, lute) 3 (1d6) 10 (3d6)
Medium (barrel, chandelier) 4 (1d8) 18 (4d8)
Large (cart, dining table) 5 (1d10) 27 (5d10)
 Damage Types and Objects. Objects have Immu -
nity to Poison and Psychic damage. The GM might 
decide that some damage types are more or less ef -
fective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning 
damage works well for smashing things but not for 
cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnera-
bility to Fire damage.
 Damage Threshold. Big objects, such as castle 
walls, often have extra resilience represented by a 
damage threshold. See also  “Damage Threshold.”
 No Ability Scores. An object lacks ability scores 
unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without 
ability scores, an object can’t make ability checks, 
and it fails all saving throws.
Bright Light
Bright Light is normal illumination. See also  “Play -
ing the Game” (“Exploration”).
Burning [Hazard]
A burning creature or object takes 1d4 Fire damage 
at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you 
can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself 
the Prone condition and rolling on the ground. 
The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or 
suffocated.
Burrow Speed
A creature that has a Burrow Speed can use that 
speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. The 
creature can’t burrow through solid rock unless the 
creature has a trait that allows it to do so. See also  
“Speed.”Campaign
A campaign is a series of adventures. See also  
“Adventure.”
Cantrip
A cantrip is a level 0 spell, which is cast without a 
spell slot. See also  “Spells.”
Carrying Capacity
Your size and Strength score determine the maxi -
mum weight in pounds that you can carry, as shown 
in the Carrying Capacity table. The table also shows 
the maximum weight you can drag, lift, or push.
 While dragging, lifting, or pushing weight in ex -
cess of the maximum weight you can carry, your 
Speed can be no more than 5 feet.
Carrying Capacity
Creature Size Carry Drag/Lift/Push
Tiny Str. × 7.5 lb. Str. × 15 lb.
Small/Medium Str. × 15 lb. Str. × 30 lb.
Large Str. × 30 lb. Str. × 60 lb.
Huge Str. × 60 lb. Str. × 120 lb.
Gargantuan Str. × 120 lb. Str. × 240 lb.
Challenge Rating
Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a 
monster poses to a group of four player characters. 
Compare a monster’s CR to the characters’ level. If 
the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the 
CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat. 
But circumstances and the number of player charac -
ters can significantly alter how threatening a mon -
ster is in actual play. “Gameplay Toolbox” (“Combat 
Encounters”) provides guidance to the GM on using 
CR while planning potential combat encounters. See 
also  “Stat Block.”

you use to track your character’s information. See

Character Sheet
A character sheet is a paper or digital record that 
you use to track your character’s information. See 
also  “Character Creation.”
Charmed [Condition]
While you have the Charmed condition, you experi -
ence the following effects.
 Can’t Harm the Charmer.  You can’t attack the 
charmer or target the charmer with damaging abili -
ties or magical effects.
 Social Advantage.  The charmer has Advantage on 
any ability check to interact with you socially.
Climbing
While you’re climbing, each foot of movement costs 
1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). You 
ignore this extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and 
use it to climb.System Reference Document 5.2.1179 At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery surface or 
one with few handholds might require a successful 
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
Climb Speed
A Climb Speed can be used in place of Speed to tra-
verse a vertical surface without expending the extra 
movement normally associated with climbing. See 
also  “Climbing” and “Speed.”
Concentration
Some spells and other effects require Concentration 
to remain active, as specified in their descriptions. 
If the effect’s creator loses Concentration, the effect 
ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the ef -
fect’s description specifies how long the creator can 
concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some 
other duration. The creator can end Concentration 
at any time (no action required). The following fac -
tors break Concentration.
 Another Concentration Effect. You lose Concen-
tration on an effect the moment you start casting 
a spell that requires Concentration or activate an -
other effect that requires Concentration.
 Damage.  If you take damage, you must succeed 
on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concen -
tration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken 
(round down), whichever number is higher, up to a 
maximum DC of 30.
 Incapacitated or Dead.  Your Concentration ends 
if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die.
Condition
A condition is a temporary game state. The defini -
tion of a condition says how it affects its recipient, 
and various rules define how to end a condition. 
This glossary defines these conditions:
Blinded
Charmed
Deafened
Exhaustion
FrightenedGrappled
Incapacitated
Invisible
Paralyzed
PetrifiedPoisoned
Prone
Restrained
Stunned
Unconscious
A condition doesn’t stack with itself; a recipient 
either has a condition or doesn’t. The Exhaustion 
condition is an exception to that rule. 
Cone [Area of Effect]
A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight 
lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator 
chooses. A Cone’s width at any point along its length 
is equal to that point’s distance from the point of 
origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide at a point 
along its length that is 15 feet from the point of 
origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies its 
maximum length.
 A Cone’s point of origin isn’t included in the area 
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.Cover
Cover provides a degree of protection to a target 
behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of 
which provides a different benefit to a target: Half 
Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), 
Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexter -
ity saving throws), and Total Cover (can’t be tar -
geted directly). If behind more than one degree of 
cover, a target benefits only from the most protec -
tive degree. See also  “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
Crawling
While you’re crawling, each foot of movement costs 
1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). See 
also  “Speed.”
Creature
Any being in the game, including a player’s charac -
ter, is a creature. See also  “Creature Type.”
Creature Type
Every creature, including every player character, 
has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of crea-
ture it is. Most player characters are of the Human -
oid type. These are the game’s creature types:
Aberration
Beast
Celestial
Construct
DragonElemental
Fey
Fiend
Giant
HumanoidMonstrosity
Ooze
Plant
Undead
The types don’t have rules themselves, but some 
rules in the game affect creatures of certain types 
in different ways.
Critical Hit
If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, you 
score a Critical Hit, and the attack hits regardless of 
any modifiers or the target’s AC. A Critical Hit lets 
you roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against 
the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice 
and add them together. Then add any relevant mod -
ifiers. See also  “Playing the Game” (“Damage and 
Healing”).

lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a 
face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube spec -
ifies its size, which is the length of each side.
 A Cube’s point of origin isn’t included in the area 
of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.
Curses
Some game effects curse a creature or an object. 
The effect that confers a curse defines what the 
curse does. Curses can be removed by the Remove 
Curse  and Greater Restoration  spells or other magic 
that explicitly ends curses.System Reference Document 5.2.1180Cylinder [Area of Effect]
A Cylinder is an area of effect that extends in 
straight lines from a point of origin located at the 
center of the circular top or bottom of the Cylinder. 
The effect that creates a Cylinder specifies the ra-
dius of the Cylinder’s base and the Cylinder’s height.
 A Cylinder’s point of origin is included in the area 
of effect.
D20 Test
D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of 
the game: ability checks, attack rolls, and saving 
throws. If something in the game affects D20 Tests, 
it affects all three of these rolls. The GM determines 
whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circum -
stance. See also  “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Damage
Damage represents harm that causes a creature or 
an object to lose Hit Points.
Damage Roll
A damage roll is a die roll, adjusted by any applica-
ble modifiers, that deals damage to a target. See also  
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).
Damage Threshold
A creature or an object that has a damage thresh -
old has Immunity to all damage unless it takes an 
amount of damage from a single attack or effect 
equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in 
which case it takes that entire instance of dam -
age. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the 
damage threshold is superficial and doesn’t reduce 
Hit Points. For example, if an object has a damage 
threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9 
damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to 
exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11 
damage, it takes all of that damage.
Damage Types
Attacks and other harmful effects deal different 
types of damage. Damage types have no rules of 
their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely 
on the types. The Damage Types table offers exam -
ples to help a GM assign a type to a new effect.
Damage Types
Type Examples
Acid Corrosive liquids, digestive enzymes
Bludgeoning Blunt objects, constriction, falling
Cold Freezing water, icy blasts
Fire Flames, unbearable heat
Force Pure magical energy
Lightning ElectricityType Examples
Necrotic Life-draining energy
Piercing Fangs, puncturing objects
Poison Toxic gas, venom
Psychic Mind-rending energy
Radiant Holy energy, searing radiation
Slashing Claws, cutting objects
Thunder Concussive sound
Darkness
An area of Darkness is Heavily Obscured. See 
also  “Heavily Obscured” and “Playing the Game” 
(“Exploration”).
Darkvision
If you have Darkvision, you can see in Dim Light 
within a specified range as if it were Bright Light 
and in Darkness within that range as if it were 
Dim Light. You discern colors in that Darkness 
only as shades of gray. See also  “Playing the Game” 
(“Exploration”).
Dash [Action]
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra 
movement for the current turn. The increase equals 
your Speed after applying any modifiers. With a 
Speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 
60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your Speed of 30 
feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet 
this turn if you Dash.
 If you have a special speed, such as a Fly Speed or 
Swim Speed, you can use that speed instead of your 
Speed when you take this action. You choose which 
speed to use each time you take it. See also  “Speed.”
Dead
A dead creature has no Hit Points and can’t regain 
them unless it is first revived by magic such as the 
Raise Dead  or Revivify  spell. When such a spell is 
cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can re -
fuse. The spirit of a dead creature has left the body 
and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the 
creature requires calling the spirit back. 
 If the creature returns to life, the revival effect 
determines the creature’s current Hit Points.

==================================================

--- Chunk 449 ---
Content: You choose which 
speed to use each time you take it. See also  “Speed.”
Dead
A dead creature has no Hit Points and can’t regain 
them unless it is first revived by magic such as the 
Raise Dead  or Revivify  spell. When such a spell is 
cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can re -
fuse. The spirit of a dead creature has left the body 
and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the 
creature requires calling the spirit back. 
 If the creature returns to life, the revival effect 
determines the creature’s current Hit Points. Un -
less otherwise stated, the creature returns to life 
with any conditions, magical contagions, or curses 
that were affecting it at death if the durations of 
those effects are still ongoing. If the creature died 
with any Exhaustion levels, it returns with 1 fewer 
level. If the creature had Attunement to one or more 
magic items, it is no longer attuned to them.System Reference Document 5.2.1181Deafened [Condition]
While you have the Deafened condition, you experi -
ence the following effect.
 Can’t Hear.  You can’t hear and automatically fail 
any ability check that requires hearing.
Death Saving Throw
A player character must make a Death Saving 
Throw (also called a Death Save) if they start their 
turn with 0 Hit Points. See also  “Playing the Game” 
(“Damage and Healing”).
Dehydration [Hazard]
A creature requires an amount of water per day 
based on its size, as shown in the Water Needs per 
Day table. A creature that drinks less than half the 
required water for a day gains 1 Exhaustion level 
at the day’s end. Exhaustion caused by dehydra-
tion can’t be removed until the creature drinks the 
full amount of water required for a day. See also  
“Exhaustion.”
Water Needs per Day
Size Water
Tiny 1/4 gallon
Small 1 gallon
Medium 1 gallonSize Water
Large 4 gallons
Huge 16 gallons
Gargantuan 64 gallons
Difficult Terrain
If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of move -
ment in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example, 
moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet 
of movement. Difficult Terrain isn’t cumulative; ei -
ther a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn’t.
 A space is Difficult Terrain if the space contains 
any of the following or something similar:
• A creature that isn’t Tiny or your ally
• Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or 
larger
• Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth
• Liquid that’s between shin- and waist-deep
• A narrow opening sized for a creature one size 
smaller than you
• A slope of 20 degrees or more
Difficulty Class
A Difficulty Class (DC) is the target number for an 
ability check or a saving throw. See also  “Playing the 
Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Dim Light
An area with Dim Light is Lightly Obscured. See 
also  “Lightly Obscured” and “Playing the Game” 
(“Exploration”).Disadvantage
If you have Disadvantage on a D20 Test, roll two 
d20s and use the lower roll. A roll can’t be affected 
by more than one Disadvantage, and Advantage and 
Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other. See 
also “Playing the Game” (“D20 Tests”).
Disengage [Action]
If you take the Disengage action, your movement 
doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of 
the current turn.
Dodge [Action]
If you take the Dodge action, you gain the following 
benefits: until the start of your next turn, any attack 
roll made against you has Disadvantage if you can 
see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving 
throws with Advantage.
 You lose these benefits if you have the Incapaci -
tated condition or if your Speed is 0.
Emanation [Area of Effect]
An Emanation is an area of effect that extends in 
straight lines from a creature or an object in all di -
rections. The effect that creates an Emanation spec -
ifies the distance it extends.
 An Emanation moves with the creature or object 
that is its origin unless it is an instantaneous or a 
stationary effect.
 An Emanation’s origin (creature or object) isn’t 
included in the area of effect unless its creator de -
cides otherwise.
Encounter
An encounter is a scene in an adventure that is part 
of at least one of the game’s three pillars: social in -
teraction, exploration, or combat. See also  “Playing 
the Game” (“Social Interaction,” “Exploration,” and 
“Combat”).
Enemy
A creature is your enemy if it fights against you in 
combat, actively works to harm you, or is desig -
nated as your enemy by the rules or GM.
Exhaustion [Condition]
While you have the Exhaustion condition, you 
experience the following effects.
 Exhaustion Levels. This condition is cumulative. 
Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion 
level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.
 D20 Tests Affected. When you make a D20 Test, 
the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.
 Speed Reduced.  Your Speed is reduced by a num -
ber of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.

Exhaustion [Condition]
While you have the Exhaustion condition, you 
experience the following effects.
 Exhaustion Levels. This condition is cumulative. 
Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion 
level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.
 D20 Tests Affected. When you make a D20 Test, 
the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.
 Speed Reduced.  Your Speed is reduced by a num -
ber of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.
 Removing Exhaustion Levels. Finishing a Long 
Rest removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When 
your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.System Reference Document 5.2.1182Experience Points
As they overcome challenges and complete ad -
ventures, characters earn Experience Points (XP), 
which are awarded by the Game Master. When a 
character’s XP total crosses certain thresholds, 
the character’s level increases. See also  “Level 
Advancement.”
Expertise
Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a 
skill proficiency. When you make an ability check 
with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise, 
your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for that check un -
less the bonus is doubled by another feature.
 If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one skill in 
which you have proficiency. You can’t have Exper -
tise in the same skill proficiency more than once.
 See also  “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).
Falling [Hazard]
A creature that falls takes 1d6 Bludgeoning dam -
age at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to 
a maximum of 20d6. When the creature lands, it 
has the Prone condition unless it avoids taking any 
damage from the fall.
 A creature that falls into water or another liquid 
can use its Reaction to make a DC 15 Strength (Ath -
letics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to hit the 
surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any 
damage resulting from the fall is halved.
Flying
A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While fly -
ing, you fall if you have the Incapacitated or Prone 
condition or your Fly Speed is reduced to 0. You can 
stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover. 
See also  “Falling” and “Fly Speed.”
Fly Speed
A Fly Speed can be used to travel through the air. 
While you have a Fly Speed, you can stay aloft until 
you land, fall, or die. See also  “Flying” and “Speed.”
Friendly [Attitude]
A Friendly creature views you favorably. You 
have Advantage on an ability check to influence a 
Friendly creature. See also  “Influence.”
Frightened [Condition]
While you have the Frightened condition, you expe -
rience the following effects.
 Ability Checks and Attacks Affected. You have 
Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls 
while the source of fear is within line of sight.
 Can’t Approach.  You can’t willingly move closer to 
the source of fear.Grappled [Condition]
While you have the Grappled condition, you experi -
ence the following effects.
 Speed 0.  Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
 Attacks Affected.  You have Disadvantage on at -
tack rolls against any target other than the grappler.
 Movable.  The grappler can drag or carry you 
when it moves, but every foot of movement costs it 1 
extra foot unless you are Tiny or two or more sizes 
smaller than it.
Grappling
A creature can grapple another creature. Charac -
ters typically grapple by using an Unarmed Strike. 
Many monsters have special attacks that allow 
them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is 
initiated, it follows these rules. See also  “Unarmed 
Strike” and “Grappled.”
 Grappled Condition. Successfully grappling a 
creature gives it the Grappled condition.
 One Grapple per Hand. A creature must have a 
hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat 
blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple 
using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part. What -
ever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only one 
creature at a time with that part, and the grappler 
can’t use that part to target another creature unless 
it ends the grapple.
 Ending a Grapple. A Grappled creature can use 
its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexter -
ity (Acrobatics) check against the grapple’s escape 
DC, ending the condition on itself on a success. The 
condition also ends if the grappler has the Inca-
pacitated condition or if the distance between the 
Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grap -
ple’s range. In addition, the grappler can release the 
target at any time (no action required).
Hazard
A hazard is an environmental danger. See also  
“Burning,” “Dehydration,” “Falling,” “Malnutrition,” 
and “Suffocation.”
Healing
Healing is how you regain Hit Points. See also  “Play -
ing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).

Help [Action]
When you take the Help action, you do one of the 
following.
 Assist an Ability Check. Choose one of your 
skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who is near System Reference Document 5.2.1183enough for you to assist verbally or physically when 
they make an ability check. That ally has Advantage 
on the next ability check they make with the chosen 
skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn’t 
use it before the start of your next turn. The GM has 
final say on whether your assistance is possible.
 Assist an Attack Roll. You momentarily distract 
an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving Advantage to 
the next attack roll by one of your allies against that 
enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next 
turn.
Heroic Inspiration
If you (a player character) have Heroic Inspiration, 
you can expend it to reroll any die immediately af -
ter rolling it, and you must use the new roll.
 If you gain Heroic Inspiration but already have it, 
it’s lost unless you give it to a player character who 
lacks it.
Hide [Action]
With the Hide action, you try to hide yourself. To do 
so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) 
check while you’re Heavily Obscured or behind 
Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover, and you must 
be out of any enemy’s line of sight; if you can see a 
creature, you can discern whether it can see you.
 On a successful check, you have the Invisible con -
dition while hidden. Make note of your check’s total, 
which is the DC for a creature to find you with a 
Wisdom (Perception) check.
 You stop being hidden immediately after any of 
the following occurs: you make a sound louder than 
a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack 
roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.
High Jump
When you make a High Jump, you leap into the 
air a number of feet equal to 3 plus your Strength 
modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 
10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When 
you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only 
half that distance. Either way, each foot of the jump 
costs a foot of movement.
 You can extend your arms half your height above 
yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach a dis -
tance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times 
your height.
Hit Point Dice
Hit Point Dice, or Hit Dice for short, help determine 
a player character’s Hit Point maximum, as ex -
plained in “Character Creation.” Most monsters also 
have Hit Dice. A creature can spend Hit Dice during 
a Short Rest to regain Hit Points. See also  “Short 
Rest.”Hit Points
Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is 
to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage 
reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them. 
You can’t have more Hit Points than your Hit Point 
maximum, and you can’t have less than 0. See also  
“Breaking Objects” and “Playing the Game” (“Dam -
age and Healing”).
Hostile [Attitude]
A Hostile creature views you unfavorably. You have 
Disadvantage on an ability check to influence a Hos -
tile creature. See also  “Influence.”
Hover
Some creatures can hover, as noted in their stat 
blocks, and some spells and other effects grant the 
ability to hover. Hovering while flying prevents 
you from falling in certain circumstances. See also  
“Flying.”
Illusions
Spells and other effects sometimes create magical il -
lusions. Such an effect defines what the illusion does 
and which senses or mental faculties it deceives.
 If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is 
insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be 
affected by the environment as if the illusion were 
real unless the effect that created it specifies oth -
erwise. For example, a visual illusion of a creature 
casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears 
to affect the illusory creature. Similarly, an audible 
illusion echoes in an echoey space.
Immunity
If you have Immunity to a damage type or a condi -
tion, it doesn’t affect you in any way.

Immunity
If you have Immunity to a damage type or a condi -

Improvised Weapons
An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a 
makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, 
or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also 
counts as an improvised weapon if it’s wielded in 
a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged 
weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Me -
lee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the 
weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An impro -
vised weapon follows the rules below.
 Proficiency. Don’t add your Proficiency Bonus to 
attack rolls with an improvised weapon.
 Damage.  On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage 
of a type the GM thinks is appropriate for the object.
 Range.  If you throw the weapon, it has a normal 
range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
 Weapon Equivalents.  If an improvised weapon 
resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the GM may 
say it functions as that weapon and uses that weap -
on’s rules. For example, the GM could treat a table 
leg as a Club.System Reference Document 5.2.1184Incapacitated [Condition]
While you have the Incapacitated condition, you ex -
perience the following effects.
 Inactive.  You can’t take any action, Bonus Action, 
or Reaction.
 No Concentration. Your Concentration is broken.
 Speechless.  You can’t speak.
 Surprised.  If you’re Incapacitated when you roll 
Initiative, you have Disadvantage on the roll.
Indifferent [Attitude]
An Indifferent creature has no desire to help or hin -
der you. Indifferent is the default attitude of a mon -
ster. See also  “Influence.”
Influence [Action]
With the Influence action, you urge a monster to 
do something. Describe or roleplay how you’re 
communicating with the monster. Are you trying to 
deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The 
GM then determines whether the monster feels will -
ing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction; 
this determination establishes whether an ability 
check is necessary, as explained below.
 Willing.  If your urging aligns with the monster’s 
desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster 
fulfills your request in a way it prefers.
 Unwilling.  If your urging is repugnant to the mon -
ster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is 
necessary; it doesn’t comply.
 Hesitant.  If you urge the monster to do something 
that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability 
check, which is affected by the monster’s attitude: 
Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is 
defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks ta-
ble suggests which ability check to make based on 
how you’re interacting with the monster. The GM 
chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to 
15 or the monster’s Intelligence score, whichever 
is higher. On a successful check, the monster does 
as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours 
(or a duration set by the GM) before urging it in the 
same way again.
Influence Checks
Ability Check Interaction
Charisma (Deception) Deceiving a monster 
that understands you
Charisma (Intimidation) Intimidating a monster
Charisma (Performance) Amusing a monster
Charisma (Persuasion) Persuading a monster 
that understands you
Wisdom (Animal Handling) Gently coaxing a Beast 
or MonstrosityInitiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during com -
bat. The combat rules in “Playing the Game” explain 
how to roll Initiative.
 Sometimes a GM might have combatants use 
their Initiative scores instead of rolling Initiative. 
Your Initiative score equals 10 plus your Dexterity 
modifier. If you have Advantage on Initiative rolls, 
increase your Initiative score by 5. If you have Dis -
advantage on those rolls, decrease that score by 5. 
See also  “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
Invisible [Condition]
While you have the Invisible condition, you experi -
ence the following effects.
 Surprise.  If you’re Invisible when you roll Initia-
tive, you have Advantage on the roll.
 Concealed.  You aren’t affected by any effect that 
requires its target to be seen unless the effect’s cre -
ator can somehow see you. Any equipment you are 
wearing or carrying is also concealed.
 Attacks Affected.  Attack rolls against you have 
Disadvantage, and your attack rolls have Advan -
tage. If a creature can somehow see you, you don’t 
gain this benefit against that creature.
Jumping
When you jump, you make either a Long Jump (hor -
izontal) or a High Jump (vertical). See also  “Long 
Jump” and “High Jump.”
Knocking Out a Creature
When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points

==================================================

--- Chunk 453 ---
Content: be seen unless the effect’s cre -
ator can somehow see you. Any equipment you are 
wearing or carrying is also concealed.
 Attacks Affected.  Attack rolls against you have 
Disadvantage, and your attack rolls have Advan -
tage. If a creature can somehow see you, you don’t 
gain this benefit against that creature.
Jumping
When you jump, you make either a Long Jump (hor -
izontal) or a High Jump (vertical). See also  “Long 
Jump” and “High Jump.”
Knocking Out a Creature
When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points 
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the 
creature to 1 Hit Point. The creature then has the 
Unconscious condition and starts a Short Rest.
 The creature remains Unconscious until it regains 
any Hit Points or until someone uses an action to 
administer first aid to it, which requires a success -
ful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
Lightly Obscured
You have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks to see something in a Lightly Obscured 
space. See also  “Dim Light” and “Playing the Game” 
(“Exploration”).
Line [Area of Effect]
A Line is an area of effect that extends from a point 
of origin in a straight path along its length and cov -
ers an area defined by its width. The effect that cre -
ates a Line specifies its length and width.
 A Line’s point of origin isn’t included in the area of 
effect unless its creator decides otherwise.
Long Jump
When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally 
a number of feet up to your Strength score if you System Reference Document 5.2.1185move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump. 
When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap 
only half that distance. Either way, each foot you 
jump costs a foot of movement.
 If you land in Difficult Terrain, you must succeed 
on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or have the 
Prone condition.
 This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of 
the jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a 
stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must suc -
ceed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a 
low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s 
distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, 
you hit the obstacle.
Long Rest
A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at 
least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a 
Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and per -
form no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as 
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
 During sleep, you have the Unconscious condition. 
After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least 
16 hours before starting another one.
 Benefits of the Rest. To start a Long Rest, you 
must have at least 1 Hit Point. When you finish the 
rest, you gain the following benefits:
Regain All HP. You regain all lost Hit Points and all 
spent Hit Point Dice. If your Hit Point maximum 
was reduced, it returns to normal.
Ability Scores Restored.  If any of your ability 
scores were reduced, they return to normal.
Exhaustion Reduced.  If you have the Exhaustion 
condition, its level decreases by 1.
Special Feature.  Some features are recharged by a 
Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges 
in the way specified in its description.
 Interrupting the Rest. A Long Rest is stopped by 
the following interruptions:
• Rolling Initiative
• Casting a spell other than a cantrip
• Taking any damage
• 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion
If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption, 
you gain the benefits of a Short Rest. See also  “Short 
Rest.”
 You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an 
interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 addi -
tional hour per interruption to finish.
Magic [Action]
When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell 
that has a casting time of an action or use a feature 
or magic item that requires a Magic action to be 
activated. If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 min -
ute or longer, you must take the Magic action on 
each turn of that casting, and you must maintain 
Concentration while you do so. If your Concentra-
tion is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a 
spell slot. See also  “Concentration.”
Magical Effect
An effect is magical if it is created by a spell, a magic 
item, or a phenomenon that a rule labels as magical.
Malnutrition [Hazard]
A creature needs an amount of food per day based 
on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day ta-
ble. A creature that eats but consumes less than half 
the required food for a day must succeed on a DC 
10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion 
level at the day’s end. A creature that eats nothing 
for 5 days

==================================================

--- Chunk 454 ---
Content: the spell fails, but you don’t expend a 
spell slot. See also  “Concentration.”
Magical Effect
An effect is magical if it is created by a spell, a magic 
item, or a phenomenon that a rule labels as magical.
Malnutrition [Hazard]
A creature needs an amount of food per day based 
on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day ta-
ble. A creature that eats but consumes less than half 
the required food for a day must succeed on a DC 
10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion 
level at the day’s end. A creature that eats nothing 
for 5 days automatically gains 1 Exhaustion level at 
the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level 
at the end of each subsequent day without food.
 Exhaustion caused by malnutrition can’t be re -
moved until the creature eats the full amount of 
food required for a day. See also  “Exhaustion.”
Food Needs per Day
Size Food Size Food
Tiny 1/4 pound Large 4 pounds
Small 1 pound Huge 16 pounds
Medium 1 pound Gargantuan 64 pounds
Monster
A monster is a creature controlled by the GM, even 
if the creature is benevolent. See also  “Creature” and 
“NPC.”
Nonplayer Character
A nonplayer character (NPC) is a monster that has 
a personal name and a distinct personality. See also  
“Monster.”
Object
An object is a nonliving, distinct thing. Composite 
things, like buildings, comprise more than one ob -
ject. See also  “Breaking Objects.”
Occupied Space
A space is occupied if a creature is in it or if it is 
completely filled by objects.
Opportunity Attacks
You can make an Opportunity Attack when a crea-
ture that you can see leaves your reach using its 
action, its Bonus Action, its Reaction, or one of its 
speeds. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a Re -
action to make one melee attack with a weapon or 
an Unarmed Strike against the provoking creature. 
The attack occurs right before the creature leaves 
your reach. See also  “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).System Reference Document 5.2.1186Paralyzed [Condition]
While you have the Paralyzed condition, you experi -
ence the following effects.
 Incapacitated.  You have the Incapacitated 
condition.
 Speed 0.  Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
 Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail 
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
 Attacks Affected.  Attack rolls against you have 
Advantage.
 Automatic Critical Hits. Any attack roll that hits 
you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of 
you.
Passive Perception
Passive Perception is a score that reflects a crea-
ture’s general awareness of its surroundings. The 
GM uses this score when determining whether a 
creature notices something without consciously 
making a Wisdom (Perception) check.
 A creature’s Passive Perception equals 10 plus the 
creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check bonus. If the 
creature has Advantage on such checks, increase 
the score by 5. If the creature has Disadvantage on 
them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level 
1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in 
Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 + 
2). If that character has Advantage on Wisdom (Per -
ception) checks, the score becomes 19.
Per Day
If a rule says you can use something a certain num -
ber of times per day, that means you must finish a 
Long Rest to use it again after you run out of uses.
Petrified [Condition]
While you have the Petrified condition, you experi -
ence the following effects.
 Turned to Inanimate Substance.  You are trans -
formed, along with any nonmagical objects you are 
wearing and carrying, into a solid inanimate sub -
stance (usually stone). Your weight increases by a 
factor of ten, and you cease aging.
 Incapacitated.  You have the Incapacitated 
condition.
 Speed 0.  Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
 Attacks Affected.  Attack rolls against you have 
Advantage.
 Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail 
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
 Resist Damage. You have Resistance to all 
damage.
 Poison Immunity.  You have Immunity to the Poi -
soned condition.
Player Character
A player character is a character controlled by a 
player. See also  “Character Creation.”Poisoned [Condition]
While you have the Poisoned condition, you experi -
ence the following effect.
 Ability Checks and Attacks Affected. You have 
Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
Possession
Some effects cause a creature to be possessed by 
another creature or entity. A possessing effect de -
fines how the possession operates. Possession can 
be prevented by the Protection from Evil and Good 
spell and ended by the Dispel Evil and Good spell.
Proficiency
If you have proficiency with something, you can add 
your Proficiency Bonus to any D20 Test you make 
using that thing. A creature might have proficiency 
in a skill or saving throw or with a weapon or tool. 
See also  “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).

fines how the possession operates. Possession can 
be prevented by the Protection from Evil and Good 
spell and ended by the Dispel Evil and Good spell.
Proficiency
If you have proficiency with something, you can add 
your Proficiency Bonus to any D20 Test you make 
using that thing. A creature might have proficiency 
in a skill or saving throw or with a weapon or tool. 
See also  “Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).
Prone [Condition]
While you have the Prone condition, you experience 
the following effects.
 Restricted Movement. Your only movement op -
tions are to crawl or to spend an amount of move -
ment equal to half your Speed (round down) to 
right yourself and thereby end the condition. If your 
Speed is 0, you can’t right yourself.
 Attacks Affected.  You have Disadvantage on at -
tack rolls. An attack roll against you has Advantage 
if the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise, 
that attack roll has Disadvantage.
Reach
A creature has a reach of 5 feet unless a rule says 
otherwise.
Reaction
A Reaction is a special action taken in response to 
a trigger defined in the Reaction’s description. You 
can take a Reaction on another creature’s turn, and 
if you take it on your turn, you can do so even if you 
also take an action, a Bonus Action, or both. Once 
you take a Reaction, you can’t take another one 
until the start of your next turn. The Opportunity 
Attack is a Reaction available to all creatures. See 
also  “Opportunity Attacks” and “Playing the Game” 
(“Actions”).
Ready [Action]
You take the Ready action to wait for a particular 
circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this 
action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a 
Reaction before the start of your next turn.
 First, you decide what perceivable circumstance 
will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the 
action you will take in response to that trigger, or 
you choose to move up to your Speed in response 
to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the System Reference Document 5.2.1187trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the 
zombie steps next to me, I move away.”
 When the trigger occurs, you can either take your 
Reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore 
the trigger.
 When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (ex -
pending any resources used to cast it) but hold its 
energy, which you release with your Reaction when 
the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have 
a casting time of an action, and holding on to the 
spell’s magic requires Concentration, which you can 
maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your 
Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates with -
out taking effect.
Resistance
If you have Resistance to a damage type, damage 
of that type is halved against you (round down). 
Resistance is applied only once to an instance of 
damage. See also  “Playing the Game” (“Damage and 
Healing”).
Restrained [Condition]
While you have the Restrained condition, you expe -
rience the following effects.
 Speed 0.  Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
 Attacks Affected.  Attack rolls against you have 
Advantage, and your attack rolls have Disadvantage.
 Saving Throws Affected. You have Disadvantage 
on Dexterity saving throws.
Ritual
If you have a spell prepared that has the Ritual tag, 
you can cast that spell as a Ritual. The Ritual ver -
sion of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than 
normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which 
means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a 
higher level. See also  “Spells.”
Round Down
Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the 
game, round down if you end up with a fraction, 
even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some 
rules make an exception and tell you to round up.
Save
Save is another name for a saving throw. See also  
“Saving Throw.”
Saving Throw
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an 
attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally 
make a saving throw only when a rule requires you 
to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without 
rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect 
that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save 
and lacks the ability score used by it, the target au -
tomatically fails. See also  “Playing the Game” (“D20 
Test s”).Search [Action]
When you take the Search action, you make a Wis -
dom check to discern something that isn’t obvious. 
The Search table suggests which skills are applica-
ble when you take this action, depending on what 
you’re trying to detect.

Insight Creature’s state of mind
Medicine Creature’s ailment or cause of death
Perception Concealed creature or object
Survival Tracks or food
Shape-Shifting
If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the Polymorph  
spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies 
what happens to you. Unless that description says 
otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—conditions, 
spells, curses, and the like—carry over from one 
form to the other. You revert to your true form if 
you die.
Short Rest
A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during 
which a creature does nothing more strenuous than 
reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start 
a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point.
 Benefits of the Rest. When you finish the rest, you 
gain the following benefits:
Spend Hit Point Dice. You can spend one or more 
of your Hit Point Dice to regain Hit Points. For 
each Hit Point Die you spend in this way, roll the 
die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You 
regain Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 1 
Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional 
Hit Point Die after each roll.
Special Feature.  Some features are recharged by a 
Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges 
in the way specified in its description.
 Interrupting the Rest. A Short Rest is stopped by 
the following interruptions:
• Rolling Initiative
• Casting a spell other than a cantrip
• Taking any damage
An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.
Simultaneous Effects
If two or more things happen at the same time on a 
turn, the person at the game table—player or GM—
whose turn it is decides the order in which those 
things happen. For example, if two effects occur at 
the start of a player character’s turn, the player de -
cides which of the effects happens first.System Reference Document 5.2.1188Size
A creature or an object belongs to a size category: 
Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. 
A creature’s size determines how much space the 
creature occupies in combat. An object’s size affects 
its Hit Points. See also  “Breaking Objects” and “Play -
ing the Game” (“Combat”).
Skill
A skill is an area of specialization associated with 
an ability check. If you have proficiency in a skill, 
you can add your Proficiency Bonus when you make 
an ability check associated with that skill. See also  
“Playing the Game” (“Proficiency”).
Speed
A creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet 
the creature can cover when it moves on its turn. 
See also  “Climbing,” “Crawling,” “Flying,” “Jumping,” 
“Swimming” and “Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
 Special Speeds.  Some creatures have special 
speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, Climb Speed, Fly 
Speed, or Swim Speed, each of which is defined 
in this glossary. If you have more than one speed, 
choose which one to use when you move; you can 
switch between the speeds during your move. 
Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already 
moved from the new speed. The result determines 
how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or 
less, you can’t use the new speed during the current 
move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a 
Fly Speed of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet, 
and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more.
 Changes to Your Speeds.  If an effect increases or 
decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed 
you have increases or decreases by an equal amount 
for the same duration. For example, if your Speed 
is reduced to 0 and you have a Climb Speed, your 
Climb Speed is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your 
Speed is halved and you have a Fly Speed, your Fly 
Speed is also halved.
Spell
A spell is a magical effect that has the characteris -
tics described in “Spells.”
Spell Attack
A spell attack is an attack roll made as part of a spell 
or another magical effect. See also  “Spells” (“Casting 
Spells”).
Spellcasting Focus
A Spellcasting Focus is an object that certain crea-
tures can use in place of a spell’s Material compo -
nents if those materials aren’t consumed by the 
spell and don’t have a cost specified. Some classes 
allow its members to use certain types of Spellcast -
ing Focuses. See also  “Spells” (“Casting Spells”).Sphere [Area of Effect]

 Saving Throw Effect Notation. If an effect forces 
a saving throw, the effect’s entry starts by identify -
ing the kind of saving throw required and then pro -
vides the save’s DC, a description of which creatures 
must make the save, and what happens on a failed 
or a successful save.
 Damage Notation. A stat block usually provides 
both a static number and a die expression for each 
instance of damage. For example, an attack might 
deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. The GM deter -
mines whether you use the static number or the die 
expression in parentheses; you don’t use both.
Study [Action]
When you take the Study action, you make an Intel -
ligence check to study your memory, a book, a clue, 
or another source of knowledge and call to mind an 
important piece of information about it.

Stunned [Condition]
While you have the Stunned condition, you experi -
ence the following effects.
 Incapacitated.  You have the Incapacitated 
condition.
 Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail 
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
 Attacks Affected.  Attack rolls against you have 
Advantage.
Suffocation [Hazard]
A creature can hold its breath for a number of 
minutes equal to 1 plus its Constitution modifier 
(minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins. 
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, 
it gains 1 Exhaustion level at the end of each of 
its turns. When a creature can breathe again, it 
removes all levels of Exhaustion it gained from 
suffocating.
Surprise
If a creature is caught unawares by the start of 
combat, that creature is surprised, which causes it 
to have Disadvantage on its Initiative roll. See also  
“Playing the Game” (“Combat”).
Swimming
While you’re swimming, each foot of movement 
costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in Difficult Terrain). 
You ignore this extra cost if you have a Swim Speed 
and use it to swim. At the GM’s option, moving any 
distance in rough water might require a successful 
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
Swim Speed
A Swim Speed can be used to swim without expend -
ing the extra movement normally associated with 
swimming. See also  “Swimming” and “Speed.”System Reference Document 5.2.1190Target
A target is the creature or object targeted by an 
attack roll, forced to make a saving throw by an 
effect, or selected to receive the effects of a spell or 
another phenomenon.
Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature 
to communicate mentally with another creature 
within a specified range. Unless a rule states other -
wise, the contacted creature doesn’t need to share a 
language with the telepath to understand this com -
munication, but the contacted creature must be able 
to understand at least one language or be telepathic 
itself to understand.
 A telepath doesn’t need to see a contacted crea-
ture, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic 
contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic 
contact can’t be initiated and is immediately broken 
if either the telepath or the other creature has the 
Incapacitated condition. Telepathic contact is also 
broken if the contacted creature is no longer within 
the telepathy’s range or if the telepath contacts a 
different creature within range.
 A creature without telepathy can receive tele -
pathic messages but can’t initiate a telepathic con -
versation. Once a telepathic conversation starts, 
the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the 
telepath until the telepathic connection ends.
Teleportation
Teleportation is a special kind of magical transpor -
tation. If you teleport, you disappear and reappear 
elsewhere instantly, without moving through the 
intervening space. This transportation doesn’t ex -
pend movement unless a rule tells you otherwise, 
and teleportation never provokes Opportunity 
Attacks.
 When you teleport, all the equipment you’re 
wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you’re 
touching another creature when you teleport, that 
creature doesn’t teleport with you unless the tele -
portation effect says otherwise.
 If the destination space of your teleportation is 
occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid 
obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccu -
pied space of your choice.
 The description of a teleportation effect tells you 
if you must see the teleportation’s destination.
Temporary Hit Points
Temporary Hit Points are granted by certain effects 
and act as a buffer against losing real Hit Points. See 
also  “Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).Tremorsense
A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the loca-
tion of creatures and moving objects within a spe -
cific range, provided that the creature with Trem -
orsense and anything it is detecting are both in 
contact with the same surface (such as the ground, 
a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.
 Tremorsense can’t detect creatures or objects in 
the air, and it doesn’t count as a form of sight.
Truesight
If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced 
within a specified range. Within that range, your 
vision pierces

cific range, provided that the creature with Trem -
orsense and anything it is detecting are both in 
contact with the same surface (such as the ground, 
a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.
 Tremorsense can’t detect creatures or objects in 
the air, and it doesn’t count as a form of sight.
Truesight
If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced 
within a specified range. Within that range, your 
vision pierces through the following:
Darkness.  You can see in normal and magical 
Darkness.
Invisibility.  You see creatures and objects that have 
the Invisible condition.
Visual Illusions. Visual illusions appear transpar -
ent to you, and you automatically succeed on sav -
ing throws against them.
Transformations.  You discern the true form of any 
creature or object you see that has been trans -
formed by magic.
Ethereal Plane.  You see into the Ethereal Plane. 
Unarmed Strike
Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, 
you can use a punch, kick, headbutt, or similar 
forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed 
Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your 
body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 
feet of you.
 Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose 
one of the following options for its effect.
 Damage.  You make an attack roll against the 
target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength 
modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the 
target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus 
your Strength modifier.
 Grapple.  The target must succeed on a Strength 
or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it 
has the Grappled condition. The DC for the saving 
throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your 
Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grap -
ple is possible only if the target is no more than one 
size larger than you and if you have a hand free to 
grab it. See also  “Grappling.”
 Shove.  The target must succeed on a Strength or 
Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you ei -
ther push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the Prone 
condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus 
your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This 
shove is possible only if the target is no more than 
one size larger than you.System Reference Document 5.2.1191Unconscious [Condition]
While you have the Unconscious condition, you ex -
perience the following effects.
 Inert.  You have the Incapacitated and Prone 
conditions, and you drop whatever you’re holding. 
When this condition ends, you remain Prone.
 Speed 0.  Your Speed is 0 and can’t increase.
 Attacks Affected.  Attack rolls against you have 
Advantage.
 Saving Throws Affected. You automatically fail 
Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
 Automatic Critical Hits. Any attack roll that hits 
you is a Critical Hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of 
you.
 Unaware.  You’re unaware of your surroundings.
Unoccupied Space
A space is unoccupied if no creatures are in it and it 
isn’t completely filled by objects.
Utilize [Action]
You normally interact with an object while doing 
something else, such as when you draw a sword as 
part of the Attack action. When an object requires 
an action for its use, you take the Utilize action.
Vulnerability
If you have Vulnerability to a damage type, damage 
of that type is doubled against you. Vulnerability is 
applied only once to an instance of damage. See also  
“Playing the Game” (“Damage and Healing”).
Weapon
A weapon is an object that is in the Simple or 
Martial weapon category. See also  “Equipment” 
(“Weapons”).
Weapon Attack
A weapon attack is an attack roll made with a 
weapon. See also  “Weapon.”System Reference Document 5.2.1192Gameplay Toolbox
Travel Pace
A group of characters can travel overland at a Nor -
mal, Fast, or Slow pace, as described in “Playing the 
Game.” During any journey stage, the predominant 
terrain determines the characters’ maximum travel 
pace, as shown in the Maximum Pace column of the 
Travel Terrain table. Certain factors can affect a 
group’s travel pace.
Good Roads
The presence of a good road increases the group’s 
maximum pace by one step (from Slow to Normal or 
from Normal to Fast).
Slower Travelers
The group must move at a Slow pace if any group 
member’s Speed is reduced to half or less of normal.
Extended Travel
Characters can push themselves to travel for more 
than 8 hours per day, at the risk of tiring. At the end 
of each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, 
each character must succeed on a Constitution sav -
ing throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 10 
plus 1 for each hour past 8 hours.

Slower Travelers
The group must move at a Slow pace if any group 
member’s Speed is reduced to half or less of normal.
Extended Travel
Characters can push themselves to travel for more 
than 8 hours per day, at the risk of tiring. At the end 
of each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, 
each character must succeed on a Constitution sav -

plus 1 for each hour past 8 hours.
Special Movement
If a party can travel at a high Speed for an extended 
time, as with a spell such as Wind Walk  or a magic 
item such as a Carpet of Flying , translate the party’s 
Speed into travel rates using these rules:Miles per hour = Speed ÷ 10
Miles per day (Normal pace) = Miles per hour  
× number of hours traveled (typically 8)
Fast pace  = Miles per day × 1⅓ (round down)
Slow pace  = Miles per day × 2/3 (round down)
If the characters are flying or their special move -
ment allows them to ignore Difficult Terrain, they 
can move at a Fast pace regardless of the terrain.
Vehicles
Characters traveling in a vehicle use the vehicle’s 
speed in miles per hour (as shown in “Equipment”) 
to determine their rate of travel, and they don’t 
choose a travel pace.
Creating a Background
A character’s background represents what the char -
acter did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating 
a unique background or customizing an existing 
one can reflect the particular theme of your cam -
paign or elements of your world. You can also create 
a background to help a player craft the story they 
have in mind for their character. 
 This section describes, step by step, how you can 
create backgrounds tailored for your world and the 
heroes in it.
1: Choose Abilities
Choose three abilities that seem appropriate for the 
background:
Strength or Dexterity.  These abilities are ideal for 
a background involving physical exertion.
Constitution.  This ability is ideal for a background 
that involves endurance or long hours of activity.

*Appropriate equipment (such as skis) is necessary to keep up a Fast pace in Arctic terrain.
†Characters’ rate of travel while waterborne depends on the vehicle carrying them; see “Vehicles.”System Reference Document 5.2.1193Intelligence or Wisdom. One or both abilities are 
ideal for a background that focuses on cerebral or 
spiritual matters.
Charisma.  This ability is ideal for a background 
that involves performance or social interaction.
2: Choose a Feat
Choose one feat from the Origin category. See “Ori -
gin Feats” for examples of Origin feats.
3: Choose Skill Proficiencies
Choose two skills appropriate for the background. 
There needn’t be a relationship between the skill 
proficiencies a background grants and the ability 
scores it increases.
4: Choose a Tool Proficiency
Choose one tool used in the practice of the back -
ground or often associated with it.
5: Choose Equipment
Assemble a package of equipment worth 50 GP (in -
cluding unspent gold). Don’t include Martial weap -
ons or armor, as characters get them from their 
class choices.
Curses and 
Magical Contagions
A curse is a magical burden that lasts for a specified 
time or until it is ended by some means. A magical 
contagion is an adverse effect of magical origin that 
is contagious by definition.
 The following sections discuss curses and magical 
contagions in detail.
Curses
A curse typically takes one of the forms detailed 
below.
Bestow Curse
The simplest curses are created by the Bestow Curse  
spell. The effects of such curses are limited and can 
be ended by the Remove Curse spell.
 Bestow Curse  provides useful benchmarks for 
gauging the potency of other curses. A curse that 
lasts for 1 minute equates to a level 3 spell, while 
one that lasts until dispelled equates to a level 9 
spell.
Cursed Creatures
Some monsters are associated with curses, whether 
as part of their origins or due to their ability to 
spread curses—werewolves being a prime example. You decide how a spell like Remove Curse affects 
a creature with accursed origins. For example, you 
might decide that a mummy was created through a 
curse and it can be destroyed permanently only by 
casting Remove Curse on its corpse.
Cursed Magic Items
Cursed magic items are created deliberately or 
originate as the result of supernatural events. Such 
items

Cursed Creatures
Some monsters are associated with curses, whether 
as part of their origins or due to their ability to 
spread curses—werewolves being a prime example. You decide how a spell like Remove Curse affects 
a creature with accursed origins. For example, you 
might decide that a mummy was created through a 
curse and it can be destroyed permanently only by 
casting Remove Curse on its corpse.
Cursed Magic Items
Cursed magic items are created deliberately or 
originate as the result of supernatural events. Such 
items are detailed in “Magic Items.”
Narrative Curses
A curse might manifest during an adventure when 
a creature’s violation of a taboo warrants supernat -
ural punishment, such as breaking a vow, defiling a 
tomb, or murdering an innocent. Such a curse can 
have any effects you design, or it might be a custom -
ized version of another type of curse discussed in 
this section.
 A creature affected by such a curse should know 
why they’re being punished and be able to learn 
how to end their curse, likely by symbolically 
righting the wrong they committed. How a spell 
like Remove Curse affects a curse that’s part of your 
adventure is up to you—the spell might merely sup -
press the effects of the curse for a time. Regardless, 
narrative curses should feel like rare, potent magic 
rooted in the lore of your campaign.
Environmental Curses
Some locations are so suffused with evil that any -
one who lingers there is burdened with a curse. 
Demonic Possession is one example of an environ -
mental curse.
 Demonic Possession. Demonic Possession arises 
from the chaos and evil of the Abyss and commonly 
besets creatures that interact with demonic objects 
or linger in desecrated locations, where demonic 
spirits await victims.
 A creature that becomes the target of Demonic 
Possession must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma sav -
ing throw or be possessed by a bodiless demonic 
entity. Whenever the possessed creature rolls a 1 
on a D20 Test, the demonic entity takes control of 
the creature and determines the creature’s behav -
ior thereafter. At the end of each of the possessed 
creature’s later turns, the creature makes a DC 15 
Charisma saving throw, regaining control of itself 
on a success.
 After finishing a Long Rest, a creature with De -
monic Possession makes a DC 15 Charisma saving 
throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on the 
creature. A Dispel Evil and Good spell or any magic 
that removes a curse also ends the effect on it.System Reference Document 5.2.1194Magical Contagions
Alchemists, potion brewers, and areas of wild magic 
are credited with creating the first magical con -
tagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form 
the basis of an adventure as characters search for a 
cure and try to stop the contagion’s spread.
Rest and Recuperation
If a creature infected with a magical contagion 
spends 3 days recuperating—engaging in no 
activities that would interrupt a Long Rest—the 
creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw 
at the end of the recuperation period. On a suc -
cessful save, the creature has Advantage on saving 
throws to fight off the magical contagion for the 
next 24 hours.
Example Contagions
The following examples show how magical conta-
gions can work. Feel free to alter the saving throw 
DCs, effects, and other characteristics of these con -
tagions to suit your campaign.
Cackle Fever
Magical Contagion
Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes 
tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids 
only (gnomes are strangely immune). A crea-
ture suffers the following effects 1d4 days after 
infection:
Fever.  The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level, which 
lasts until the contagion ends on the creature.
Uncontrollable Laughter.  While the creature has 
the Exhaustion condition, the creature makes 
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each time it 
takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a 
failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Psychic 
damage and has the Incapacitated condition as 
it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its 
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the 
effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it suc -
ceeds automatically.
 Fighting the Contagion. At the end of each Long 
Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 13 Constitu -
tion saving throw. After the creature succeeds on 
three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and 
the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year.
 Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid (other 
than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot 
Emanation originating from a creature infected 
with Cackle Fever must succeed on a DC 10 Consti -
tution saving throw or also become infected with 
the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid 
can’t catch the contagion from that particular in -
fected creature for the next 24 hours.Sewer Plague

can’t catch the contagion from that particular in -
fected creature for the next 24 hours.Sewer Plague
Magical Contagion
Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise 
to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and 
refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by 
creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyu -
ghs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a 
creature that carries the contagion or that comes 
into contact with contaminated filth or offal must 
succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be -
come infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers 
the following effects 1d4 days after infection:
Fatigue.  The creature gains 1 Exhaustion level.
Weakness.  While the creature has any Exhaustion 
levels, it regains only half the normal number of 
Hit Points from spending Hit Point Dice.
Restlessness.  While the creature has any Exhaus -
tion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores 
lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature’s Exhaus -
tion level.
 Fighting the Contagion. Daily at dawn, an in -
fected creature makes a DC 11 Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 Ex -
haustion level as its fatigue worsens. On a success -
ful save, the creature’s Exhaustion level decreases 
by 1. If the creature’s Exhaustion level is reduced to 
0, the contagion ends on the creature.
Sight Rot
Magical Contagion
Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted 
by Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or have the Blinded condition until the 
contagion ends.
 Fighting the Contagion. Magic such as a Heal  or 
Lesser Restoration  spell ends the contagion immedi -
ately. A character who is proficient with an Herbal -
ism Kit can use it to create one dose of nonmagical 
ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the 
eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the oint -
ment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 
24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way 
for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and 
applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on 
the creature. 
 Spreading the Contagion. Any Humanoid that 
makes skin contact with a creature infected with 
Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or also become infected with the con -
tagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can’t 
catch the contagion from that particular infected 
creature for the next 24 hours.System Reference Document 5.2.1195Environmental Effects
Deep Water
Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet 
deep) presents additional challenges because of the 
water’s pressure and cold temperature. After each 
hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that 
lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Consti -
tution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.
Extreme Cold
When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or 
lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must 
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at 
the end of each hour or gain 1 Exhaustion level. 
Creatures that have Resistance or Immunity to Cold 
damage automatically succeed on the save.
Extreme Heat
When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 
higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and 
without access to drinkable water must succeed on 
a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour 
or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 5 for the first 
hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. 
Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have 
Disadvantage on the save. Creatures that have Re -
sistance or Immunity to Fire damage automatically 
succeed on the save.
Frigid Water
A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a 
number of minutes equal to its Constitution score 
before suffering any ill effects. Each additional 
minute spent in frigid water requires the creature 
to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or 
gain 1 Exhaustion level. Creatures with Resistance 
or Immunity to Cold damage automatically suc -
ceed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally 
adapted to living in ice-cold water.Heavy Precipitation
Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy 
snowfall is Lightly Obscured, and creatures in the 
area have Disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) 
checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.
High Altitude
Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above 
sea level is taxing for most creatures because of the 
reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such 
a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts 
as 2 hours for the purpose

Content: Creatures with Resistance 
or Immunity to Cold damage automatically suc -
ceed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally 
adapted to living in ice-cold water.Heavy Precipitation
Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy 
snowfall is Lightly Obscured, and creatures in the 
area have Disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) 
checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.
High Altitude
Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above 
sea level is taxing for most creatures because of the 
reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such 
a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts 
as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long 
that creature can travel (see “Travel Pace”).
 Creatures can become acclimated to a high alti -
tude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. 
Creatures can’t become acclimated to elevations 
above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such 
environments.
Slippery Ice
Slippery ice is Difficult Terrain. A creature that 
moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn 
or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 10 
Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.
Strong Wind
Strong wind imposes Disadvantage on ranged at -
tack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open 
flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a 
strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.
 A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm 
that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) 
checks.
Thin Ice
Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds 
per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight 
on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice 
in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall 
through. Below the ice is frigid water (see “Frigid 
Water” above).System Reference Document 5.2.1196Fear and Mental Stress
Due to the nature of their vocation, adventurers 
tend to be less susceptible to fear and mental stress 
than common folk. Whereas a farmer might flee in 
terror from a bear or an apparition, adventurers are 
made of sterner stuff. That said, certain creatures 
and game effects can terrify or fray the mind of 
even the most stalwart adventurer.
 If you plan to use any of these rules, discuss them 
with your players at the start of the campaign.
Fear Effects
Whenever the characters encounter something that 
is supernaturally frightful, use the Frightened con -
dition as the baseline effect. Fear effects typically 
require a Wisdom saving throw, with a save DC 
based on how terrifying the situation is. The Sample 
Fear DCs table provides some examples.
Sample Fear DCs
Example Save DC
When the characters open a sarcophagus, a 
harmless yet terrifying apparition appears. 10
A character triggers a magical trap that 
creates an illusory manifestation of that 
character’s worst fears, visible only to that 
character. 15
A portal to the Abyss opens, revealing a 
nightmarish realm of torment and slaughter.20
Typically, a Frightened creature repeats the saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the ef -
fect on itself on a success. 
 At your discretion, a Frightened creature might 
be subject to other effects as long as the Frightened 
condition lasts. Consider these examples:
• The Frightened creature must take the Dash ac -
tion on each of its turns and uses its movement to 
get farther away from the source of its fear.
• Attack rolls against the Frightened creature have 
Advantage.
•  The Frightened creature can do only one of the 
following on each of its turns: move, take an ac -
tion, or take a Bonus Action.Mental Stress Effects
When a character is subjected to an effect that 
causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the 
best way to emulate that effect.
 The Sample Mental Stress Effects table provides a 
few examples of such effects, with suggested saving 
throw DCs and damage. Mental stress can usually 
be resisted with a successful Wisdom save, but 
sometimes an Intelligence or Charisma save is more 
appropriate. On a successful save, a character might 
take half as much damage instead of no damage, at 
your discretion.
Sample Mental Stress Effects
ExampleSave

Damage
A character ingests a hallucinogenic 
substance that distorts the charac -
ter’s perception of reality.10 1d6
A character touches a fiendish idol 
that tears at the character’s mind,

Prolonged Effects
Exposure to mental stress can cause prolonged ef -
fects. Consider the following possibilities.
 Short-Term Effects.  The character has the Fright -
ened, Incapacitated, or Stunned condition for 1d10 
minutes. This condition might be accompanied by 
alarming behavior or hallucinations. These effects 
can be suppressed with the Calm Emotions spell or 
removed by the Lesser Restoration  spell.

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are 
a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures.
 Poisons come in the following four types:
Contact.  Contact poison can be smeared on an 
object and remains potent until it is touched or 
washed off. A creature that touches contact poi -
son with exposed skin suffers its effects.
Ingested.  A creature must swallow an entire dose 
of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose 
can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may de -
cide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such 
as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or 
dealing only half as much damage on a failed save.
Inhaled.  Poisonous powders and gases take effect 
when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing 
the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its 
effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately 
afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective 
against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal mem -
branes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
Injury.  Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus 
Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or 
similar object. The poison remains potent until 
delivered through a wound or washed off. A crea-
ture that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from 
an object coated with the poison is exposed to its 
effects.
Purchasing Poison
In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and 
use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous 
apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters 
with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poi -
son easily. Other characters might have to make ex -
tensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire 
the poison they seek.
Harvesting Poison
A character can attempt to harvest poison from a 
venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapaci -
tated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after 
which the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence 
(Nature) check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On a success -
ful check, the character harvests enough poison 
for a single dose, and no additional poison can be 
harvested from that creature. On a failed check, 
the character is unable to extract any poison. If the 
character fails the check by 5 or more, the character 
is subjected to the creature’s poison.Sample Poisons
Example poisons are detailed here in alphabetical 
order. Each poison’s description includes the sug -
gested price for a single dose of the poison, its type 
(contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury), and a descrip -
tion of the poison’s debilitating effects.

Inhaled Poison
A creature subjected to Burnt Othur Fumes must 
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or 
take 10 (3d6) Poison damage, and it must repeat the

Traps should be used sparingly, lest they lose their 
charm. A hidden pit can be a fun surprise, but too 
many traps in an adventure can lead players to be -
come overly cautious, which slows down the game.
 The best traps are fleeting distractions that 
skilled characters can overcome in a short amount 
of time or deadly puzzles that require quick think -
ing and teamwork to overcome. Traps that are un -
detectable and inescapable are rarely fun.
Parts of a Trap
The description of a trap includes the following 
parts after the trap’s name:
Severity and Levels.  A trap is designated as a nui -
sance or as deadly for characters of certain levels.  
A nuisance trap is unlikely to seriously harm char -
acters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly 
trap can grievously damage characters of the indi -
cated levels.
Trigger.  Traps are often set to go off when a crea-
ture enters an area or touches an object. Examples 
of triggers include stepping on a pressure plate, 
crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using 
the wrong key in a lock.
Duration. Some traps have durations expressed 
in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that 
their effects last until the trap is destroyed or 
dispelled. If a trap’s duration is instantaneous, its 
effect is

Content: nuisance trap is unlikely to seriously harm char -
acters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly 
trap can grievously damage characters of the indi -
cated levels.
Trigger.  Traps are often set to go off when a crea-
ture enters an area or touches an object. Examples 
of triggers include stepping on a pressure plate, 
crossing a trip wire, turning a doorknob, or using 
the wrong key in a lock.
Duration. Some traps have durations expressed 
in rounds, minutes, or hours. Others specify that 
their effects last until the trap is destroyed or 
dispelled. If a trap’s duration is instantaneous, its 
effect is resolved instantly. If a trap resets after 
activating, that fact is noted in this entry. A trap is 
otherwise inert after activation.
Use caution when introducing a trap to characters 
of a level lower than the trap’s level range. A trap 
that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly 
to characters of a lower level range.
Example Traps
Traps are presented in alphabetical order.
Collapsing Roof
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger:  A creature crosses a trip wire
Duration:  Instantaneous
This trap uses a trip wire to collapse an unstable 
section of ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the 
ground and stretches between two weak supports 
that topple when the trip wire is pulled.
 The first creature that crosses the trip wire 
causes the supports to topple and the unstable sec -
tion of ceiling to collapse. Each creature beneath the 
unstable section of ceiling must succeed on a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Bludgeon -
ing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Rubble from the collapse turns 
the trapped area into Difficult Terrain.  
 Detect and Disarm.  As a Search action, a creature 
can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11 
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire 
and the unstable section of ceiling on a successful 
check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut 
or avoided (no ability check required).
 At Higher Levels.  You can scale the trap for higher 
levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as 
shown in the following table. 
Levels Bludgeoning Damage Save DC
5–10 22 (4d10) 15
11–16 55 (10d10) 17
17–20 99 (18d10) 19
Falling Net
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger:  A creature crosses a trip wire
Duration:  Instantaneous
A falling net trap uses a trip wire to release a 
weighted, 10-foot-square Net suspended from the 
ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and 
stretches between two columns or trees. 
 The first creature that crosses the trip wire 
causes the Net to fall on it. The target must suc -
ceed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the 
Restrained condition until it escapes. The target 
succeeds automatically if it’s Huge or larger. A crea-
ture can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength 
(Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature 
within its reach from the Net on a successful check.  
 Detect and Disarm.  As a Search action, a creature 
can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11 
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the trip wire 
and the suspended Net on a successful check. Once 
detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided 
(no ability check required).
 Destroy the Net. Reducing the Net to 0 Hit Points 
frees any creature trapped in it (see “Adventuring 
Gear” for the Net’s statistics).
 Set the Trap. A creature that has Thieves’ Tools 
and all the trap’s components (including a Net) can 
try to set a falling net trap, doing so with a success -
ful DC 13 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. Each 
attempt to set this trap takes 10 minutes.
 At Higher Levels.  You can scale the trap for higher 
levels by increasing the weight of the Net, which 
increases the save DC and the DC of the Strength 
(Athletics) check as follows: DC 12 at levels 5–10, DC 
14 at levels 11–16, or DC 16 at levels 17–20. 
Fire-Casting Statue
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger:  A creature moves onto a pressure plateSystem Reference Document 5.2.1200Duration:  Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the 
start of the next turn
When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure 
plate for the first time on a turn or starts its turn 
there, a nearby statue exhales a 15-foot Cone of 
magical flame. The statue can look like anything, 
such as a dragon or a wizard. Each creature in the 
Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw, taking 11 (2d10) Fire damage on a failed 
save or half as much damage on a successful one. 
 Detect and Disarm.  A Detect Magic  spell reveals 
an aura of Evocation magic around the statue. As a 
Search action, a creature within 5 feet of

successful check. Once the glyph is found, a charac -
ter can take a Study action to examine it and make a 
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, ascertaining that 
the glyph means “fire” on a successful check. As an 
action, a character can use a sharp tool to deface the 
glyph, which disarms the trap.
 As a Search action, a creature can examine the 
section of floor that forms the pressure plate and 
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting 
the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging 
an Iron Spike or similar object under the pressure 
plate prevents the trap from triggering. 
 At Higher Levels.  You can scale the trap for higher 
levels by increasing the damage and the area of ef -
fect, as shown in the following table.
Levels Fire Damage Area of Effect
5–10 22 (4d10) 30-foot Cone
11–16 55 (10d10) 60-foot Cone
17–20 99 (18d10) 120-foot Cone
Hidden Pit
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger:  A creature moves onto the pit’s lid
Duration:  Instantaneous
This 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed 
from material identical to the surrounding floor. 
When a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open 
like a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the 
pit. The lid remains open thereafter.
 A creature that falls into the pit takes 3 (1d6) 
Bludgeoning damage from the fall.
 Detect and Disarm.  As a Study action, a creature 
can examine the section of floor that forms the 
pit’s lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investiga-
tion) check, detecting the pit on a successful check. 
Once the pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar 
object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the 
surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening, 
thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also 
be held shut using Arcane Lock  or similar magic. Escape.  A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing 
gear, or magic such as Spider Climb  to scale the pit’s 
smooth walls. You can make the pit easier to escape 
by adding cracks in the walls big enough to serve as 
handholds and footholds. 
 At Higher Levels.  You can scale the trap for higher 
levels by increasing the pit’s depth and damage, as 
shown in the following table. 
Levels Pit Depth Bludgeoning Damage
5–10 30 feet 10 (3d6)
11–16 60 feet 21 (6d6)
17–20 120 feet 42 (12d6)
Poisoned Darts
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger:  A creature moves onto a pressure plate
Duration:  Instantaneous, and the trap resets at the 
start of the next turn if it has activated fewer than 
three times
When a creature moves onto this trap’s pressure 
plate for the first time on a turn, poisoned darts 
shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding 
walls. The holes that house these tubes are ob -
scured by dust and cobwebs or skillfully hidden 
amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes.
 Each creature in the darts’ path must succeed on 
a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by 1d3 
darts, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage per dart.
 Detect and Disarm.  As a Search action, a creature 
can examine the walls and make a DC 15 Wisdom 
(Perception) check, detecting the holes on a suc -
cessful check. Plugging all the holes with wax, cloth, 
or detritus prevents the darts from firing. 
 As a Search action, a creature can examine the 
section of floor that forms the pressure plate and 
make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting 
the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging 
an Iron Spike or a similar object under the pressure 
plate prevents the trap from triggering. 
 At Higher Levels.  You can scale the trap for higher 
levels by increasing each dart’s Poison damage as 
follows: 7 (2d6) at levels 5–10, 14 (4d6) at levels 
11–16, or 24 (7d6) at levels 17–20.
Poisoned Needle
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger:  A creature opens the trap’s lock improperly 
or fails to disarm the trap
Duration:  Instantaneous
A poisoned needle is hidden in a lock. When a crea-
ture opens the lock with any object other than the 
proper key, the needle springs out and stabs

 At Higher Levels.  You can scale the trap for higher 
levels by increasing each dart’s Poison damage as 
follows: 7 (2d6) at levels 5–10, 14 (4d6) at levels 
11–16, or 24 (7d6) at levels 17–20.
Poisoned Needle
Nuisance Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger:  A creature opens the trap’s lock improperly 
or fails to disarm the trap
Duration:  Instantaneous
A poisoned needle is hidden in a lock. When a crea-
ture opens the lock with any object other than the 
proper key, the needle springs out and stabs the 
creature. The creature makes a DC 11 Constitution 
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 
5 (1d10) Poison damage and has the Poisoned System Reference Document 5.2.1201condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, the crea-
ture takes half as much damage only.  
 Avoid.  The trap doesn’t trigger if the lock is 
opened using a Knock  spell or similar magic.
 Detect and Disarm.  As a Search action, a creature 
can examine the trapped lock and make a DC 15 
Wisdom (Perception) check, detecting the needle on 
a successful check. Once the trap is detected, a char -
acter can take an action to try to disarm the trap, 
doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight 
of Hand) check. On a failed check, the creature trig -
gers the trap.
 At Higher Levels.  You can scale the trap for higher 
levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as 
shown in the following table. 
Levels Poison Damage Save DC
5–10 11 (2d10) 13
11–16 22 (4d10) 15
17–20 55 (10d10) 17
Rolling Stone
Deadly Trap (Levels 11–16) or Nuisance Trap (Levels 
17–20)
Trigger:  A creature moves onto a pressure plate
Duration:  Until the stone stops rolling
When a creature moves onto a hidden pressure 
plate, a 5-foot-radius orb of solid stone is released 
from a secret compartment and begins to roll. The 
stone and all creatures nearby roll Initiative; the 
stone gets a +8 bonus on its Initiative roll.
 On its turn, the stone moves 60 feet in one direc -
tion, changing course if redirected by an obstacle. 
The stone can move through creatures’ spaces, 
and creatures can move through the stone’s space, 
treating it as Difficult Terrain. Whenever the stone 
enters a creature’s space for the first time on a turn 
or a creature enters the stone’s space while the 
stone is rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 
15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) Blud -
geoning damage and have the Prone condition.
 The stone stops when it hits a wall or similar 
barrier. It can’t go around corners, but creative 
dungeon builders incorporate curving turns into 
nearby passages that allow the stone to keep 
moving.
 Detect and Disarm.  As a Study action, a creature 
can examine the section of floor that forms the 
pressure plate and make a DC 15 Intelligence (In -
vestigation) check, deducing the pressure plate’s 
function on a successful check. Wedging an Iron 
Spike or a similar object under the pressure plate 
prevents the trap from triggering. Destroy the Stone.  The stone is a Large object 
that has AC 17, HP 100, a Damage Threshold of 10, 
and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.
 Slow the Stone. As an action, a creature can try to 
slow down the stone with a DC 20 Strength (Athlet -
ics) check. If the check is successful, the distance the 
stone moves on its turn is reduced by 15 feet. If that 
distance drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer 
a threat.
Spiked Pit
Deadly Trap (Levels 1–4)
Trigger:  A creature moves onto the pit’s lid
Duration:  Instantaneous
A 10-foot-deep pit has a hinged lid constructed from 
material identical to the surrounding floor. When 
a creature moves onto the lid, it swings open like 
a trapdoor, causing the creature to fall into the pit, 
which has sharpened wooden or metal spikes at the 
bottom. The lid remains open thereafter.
 A creature that falls into the pit lands at the 
bottom and takes 3 (1d6) Bludgeoning damage 
from the fall plus 9 (2d8) Piercing damage from 
the spikes.
 Detect and Disarm.  As a Study action, a creature 
can examine the section of floor that forms the pit’s 
lid and make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check, detecting the pit on a successful check. Once 
the hidden pit is detected, an Iron Spike or a similar 
object can be wedged between the pit’s lid and the 
surrounding floor to prevent the lid from opening, 
thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also 
be held shut using an Arcane Lock  spell or similar 
magic.
 Escape.  A creature needs a Climb Speed, climbing 
gear, or magic such as a Spider Climb

The following features can make a combat encoun -
ter more interesting or challenging:
Changes in Elevation. Terrain features that pro -
vide a change of elevation (such as stacks of empty 
crates, ledges, and balconies) reward clever posi -
tioning and encourage characters to jump, climb, 
fly, or teleport.
Defensive Positions.  Enemies in hard-to-reach 
locations or defensive positions force characters 
who normally attack at range to move around.
Mixed Monster Groups.  When different types 
of monsters work together, they can combine 
their abilities—just like characters with differ -
ent classes and origins. A diverse force is more 
powerful.
Reasons to Move. Use features that encourage 
characters and their enemies to move around, 
such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and 
rolling stone traps.
Combat Encounter Difficulty
Use the following guidelines to create a combat en -
counter of a desired level of difficulty.
Step 1: Choose a Difficulty
Three categories describe the range of encounter 
difficulty:
Low Difficulty. An encounter of low difficulty is 
likely to have one or two scary moments for the 
players, but their characters should emerge vic -
torious with no casualties. One or more of them 
might need to use healing resources, however. 
As a rough guideline, a single monster generally 
presents a low-difficulty challenge for a party of 
four characters whose level equals the monster’s 
Challenge Rating.
Moderate Difficulty. Absent healing and other re -
sources, an encounter of moderate difficulty could 
go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters 
might get taken out of the fight, and there’s a slim 
chance that one or more characters might die.
High Difficulty. A high-difficulty encounter could 
be lethal for one or more characters. To survive 
it, the characters will need smart tactics, quick 
thinking, and maybe even a little luck.
Step 2: Determine Your XP Budget
Using the XP Budget per Character table, cross-ref -
erence the party’s level with the desired encounter 
difficulty. Multiply the number in the table by the 
number of characters in the party to get your XP 
budget for the encounter.XP Budget per Character
Party’s 
Level——— Encounter Difficulty ———
Low Moderate High
1 50 75 100
2 100 150 200
3 150 225 400
4 250 375 500
5 500 750 1,100
6 600 1,000 1,400
7 750 1,300 1,700
8 1,000 1,700 2,100

19 5,500 10,700 17,200
20 6,400 13,200 22,000
Step 3: Spend Your Budget
Every creature has an XP value in its stat block. 
When you add a creature to your combat encounter, 
deduct its XP from your XP budget to determine 
how many XP you have left to spend. Spend as much 
of your XP budget as you can without going over. It’s 
OK if you have a few unspent XP left over. Examples 
are given below:
Example 1. A low-difficulty encounter for four level 
1 characters has an XP budget of 50 × 4, for a total 
of 200 XP. With that, you could build any of the fol -
lowing encounters:
•  1 Bugbear Warrior  (200 XP)
•  2 Giant Wasps  (100 XP each), for 200 XP total
•  6 Giant Rats  (25 XP each), for 150 XP total
Example 2. A moderate-difficulty encounter for 
five level 3 characters has an XP budget of 225 × 5, 
for a total of 1,125 XP. With that, you could build 
either of these encounters:
•  2 Druids  (450 XP each) and 9 Stirges  (25 XP 
each), for 1,125 XP total
•  1 Wight  (700 XP), 1 Warhorse Skeleton  (100 XP),

Troubleshooting
When creating and running combat encounters, 
keep the following in mind.
Many Creatures
The more creatures in an encounter, the higher 
the risk that a lucky streak on their part could deal 
more damage to the characters than you expect. If 
your encounter includes more than two creatures 
per character, include fragile creatures that can be 
defeated quickly. This guideline is especially im -
portant for characters of level 1 or 2.
Adjustments
A player’s absence might warrant removing crea-
tures from an encounter to keep it at the intended 
difficulty. Also, die rolls and other factors can result 
in an encounter being easier or harder than in -
tended. You can adjust an encounter on the fly, such 
as by having creatures flee (making the encounter 
easier) or adding reinforcements (making the en -
counter harder).CR 0 Creatures
Creatures that have a CR of 0, particularly ones that 
are worth 0 XP, should be used sparingly. If you 
want to include many CR 0 critters in an encounter, 
use swarms instead.
Number of Stat Blocks
The best combat encounters often pair one kind of 
creature with another, such as fire giants paired 
with hell hounds. Be mindful of the number of stat 
blocks you need to run the encounter. Referencing 
more than two or three stat blocks for a single en -
counter can be daunting, particularly if the crea-
tures are complex.
Powerful Creatures
If your combat encounter includes a creature whose 
CR is higher than the party’s level, be aware that 
such a creature might deal enough damage with a 
single action to take out one or more characters. For 
example, an Ogre  (CR 2) can kill a level 1 Wizard 
with a single blow.
Unusual Features
If a monster has a feature that lower-level charac -
ters can’t easily overcome, consider not adding that 
monster to an encounter for characters whose level 
is lower than the monster’s Challenge Rating.System Reference Document 5.2.1204Magic Items
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled 
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such 
items grant capabilities a character could rarely 
have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s 
capabilities in wondrous ways.
Magic Item Categories
Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic 
Item Categories table lists the nine categories and 
provides examples. Rules for the categories appear 
after the table.
Magic Item Categories
Category Examples
Armor +1 Leather Armor , +1 Shield
Potions Potion of Healing
Rings Ring of Invisibility
Rods Immovable Rod
Scrolls Spell Scroll
Staffs Staff of Striking
Wands Wand of Fireballs
Weapons +1 Ammunition , +1 Longsword
Wondrous Items Bag of Holding , Boots of Elvenkind
Armor
An item in the Armor category is typically a magical 
version of armor from “Equipment.” Unless an ar -
mor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must 
be worn for its magic to function.
 Some suits of magic armor specify the type of ar -
mor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If 
no type is specified, choose the type or determine it 
randomly.
Potions
An item in the Potion category might be a magical 
brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be 
applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion 
consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.
 Using a Potion. Potions are consumable items. 
Drinking a potion or administering it to another 
creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil 
might take longer as specified in its description. 
Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it 
is used up.
 Mixing Potions. A character might drink one po -
tion while still under the effects of another or pour 
several potions into a single container. The strange 
ingredients used in creating potions can result in 
unpredictable interactions. When a character mixes two potions together, roll 
on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are 
combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, 
combining the results. Unless the effects are imme -
diately obvious, reveal them only when they become 
evident.

26–35 Both potions work, but with their numerical

no numerical effect and no duration, it instead 
loses its effect.
36–90 Both potions work normally.
91–99 Both potions work, but the numerical effects 
and duration of one potion are doubled. If nei -
ther potion has anything to double in this way, 
they work normally.
00 Only one potion works, but its effects are 
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to 
make permanent or the one that seems the 
most fun. For example, a Potion of Healing 
might increase the drinker’s Hit Point maxi -
mum by 2d4 + 2, or a Potion of Invisibility  might 
give the drinker the Invisible condition indefi -
nitely. At your discretion, a Dispel Magic  spell 
or similar magic might end this lasting effect.
Rings
For its magic to function, an item in the Ring cate -
gory must be worn on a finger or a similar digit un -
less its description notes otherwise.
Rods
An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually 
made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs 
2 to 5 pounds.
 Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can 
be used as an Arcane Focus.System Reference Document 5.2.1205
Magic iteM Rules
Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic 
items appear in “Equipment.” Additional rules are 
presented below.
 Attunement Prerequisites.  If a magic item has 
a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of 
that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be 
a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qual -
ifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or 
features, not by using a magic item or the like.
 Items Made for Specific Creatures. Magic 
items that are meant to be worn tend to magically 
adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can 
decide that a magic item doesn’t adjust its size to fit 
any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might 
make items usable only by folk who are sized and 
shaped like dwarves. 
 Unusual Anatomy.  Use your discretion to decide 
whether a creature can wear an item not made for 
its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work, 
but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t 
wear magic boots.
 Paired Items. You can allow exceptions to the 
rule that paired items must both be worn. For ex -
ample, a character with only one arm might be able 
to use a single Glove of Missile Snaring so long as the 
matching glove is on their person.Scrolls
An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or 
parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods 
and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, 
leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is 
the Spell Scroll, a spell stored in written form.
 Using a Scroll. Scrolls are consumable items. Un -
leashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to 
read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked, 
the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it 
crumbles into dust.
 Any creature that can understand a written lan -
guage can read a scroll and attempt to activate it 
unless its description notes otherwise.
Staffs
Items in the Staff category vary widely in appear -
ance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout 
and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some 
are made of wood, and others are composed of pol -
ished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and 
7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.
 Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can 
be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane 
Focus.
Wands
An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15 
inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It 
is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other 
material.
 Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand 
can be used as an Arcane Focus.
Weapons
A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a 
weapon from “Equipment.” Some magic weapons 
specify the type of weapon

Weapons
A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a 
weapon from “Equipment.” Some magic weapons 
specify the type of weapon they are in their de -
scriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no 
weapon type is specified, you may choose the type 
or determine it randomly.
 Ammunition.  If a magic weapon has the Ammu -
nition property, ammunition fired from it is consid -
ered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares 
whether a weapon is magical or not.
Wondrous Items
Wondrous Items include wearable items such 
as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and 
circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical 
instruments, and more also fall into this category.Magic Item Rarity
Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a 
rough measure of an item’s power relative to other 
magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic 
Item Rarities and Values table.
 Common magic items, such as a Potion of Healing , 
are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the Dragon 
Orb, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.
Magic Item Values by Rarity
Common magic items can often be bought in a 
town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are 
usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items 
might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a 
city on another plane of existence. If you allow char -
acters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign, 
rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold 
Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities 
and Values table, though a seller might ask for a ser -
vice rather than coin as payment.
 If a magic item incorporates an item that has a 
purchase cost in “Equipment” (such as a weapon or 
a suit of armor), add that item’s cost to the magic 
item’s value. For example, +1 Armor  (Plate Armor) System Reference Document 5.2.1206has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare 
magic item’s value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate 
Armor (1,500 GP).
Magic Item Rarities and Values
Rarity Value* Rarity Value*
Common 100 GP Very Rare 40,000 GP
Uncommon 400 GP Legendary 200,000 GP
Rare 4,000 GP Artifact Priceless
*Halve the value for a consumable item other than a Spell Scroll . 
The value of a Spell Scroll  is double what it costs to scribe the scroll 
(as specified in the “Scribing Spell Scrolls” section of “Equipment”).
Activating a Magic Item
It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic 
item. The item’s user might also need to do some -
thing special. The description of each item category 
or individual item details how an item is activated. 
Certain items use the following rules for their 
activation.
Command Word
A command word is a word or short phrase that 
must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spo -
ken command words must be audible and fail to 
work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in 
the area of the Silence  spell.
Consumable Items
Some items are consumed—used up, in other 
words—when they are activated. A Potion of Healing  
must be swallowed, for example, while the writing 
vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a 
consumable item loses its magic.
Spells Cast from Items
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from 
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible 
spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the us -
er’s spell slots, and requires no components unless 
the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell 
uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, 
and the user of the item must concentrate if the 
spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as 
Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the 
spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items 
make exceptions to these rules, changing the cast -
ing time, duration, or other parts of a spell.
 A magic item may require the user to use their 
own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from 
the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting 
ability, the user chooses which one to use with the 
item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability, their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, 
and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies.
Charges
Some magic items have charges that must be ex -
pended to activate their properties. The number 
of charges an item has remaining is revealed

--- Chunk 473 ---
Content: to these rules, changing the cast -
ing time, duration, or other parts of a spell.
 A magic item may require the user to use their 
own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from 
the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting 
ability, the user chooses which one to use with the 
item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability, their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, 
and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies.
Charges
Some magic items have charges that must be ex -
pended to activate their properties. The number 
of charges an item has remaining is revealed when 
the Identify  spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to 
an item knows how many charges the item has and 
how many it regains.
“The Next Dawn”
Magic items often have charges or properties that 
recharge at the next dawn or some other specified 
time. If such an item is on a world or plane of exis -
tence where the specified event doesn’t occur, the 
GM determines when the item recharges.
Cursed Items
A magic item’s description specifies whether it 
bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, in -
cluding the Identify  spell, fail to reveal such a curse.
 Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended volun -
tarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a 
Remove Curse spell.
Magic Item Resilience
A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical 
item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Po -
tions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.
 An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special 
way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learn -
ing how to destroy an Artifact usually requires 
research or the completion of a quest.
Crafting Magic Items
“Equipment” contains rules on brewing Potions of 
Healing  and scribing Spell Scrolls . To create other 
magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules, 
“you” refers to the character crafting the magic 
item.
Arcana Proficiency
To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must 
have proficiency in the Arcana skill.
Tools
The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is re -
quired to make a magic item of each category. You 
must use the required tool to make an item and 
have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must 
also have proficiency with it. For more information 
on the tools, see “Equipment.”System Reference Document 5.2.1207Magic Item Tools

Spells
If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells 
from it, you must have all those spells prepared ev -
ery day you spend crafting the item.
Time and Cost
Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and 
money based on the item’s rarity as shown in the 
Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.
 Work per Day. For each day of crafting, you must 
work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days, 
those days needn’t be consecutive.
 Assistants.  Characters can combine their efforts 
to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed 
to create an item by the number of characters work -
ing on it. Normally, only one other character can 
assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.
 Raw Materials.  The cost in the table represents 
the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The 
GM determines whether appropriate raw materials 
are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance 
that the materials are available, and in any other 
settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials 
aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before 
checking on the availability again.
 If a magic item incorporates an item that has a 
purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), 
you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item 
using the rules in “Equipment.” For example, to 
make +1 Armor  (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500 
GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor.Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost

Common 5 days 50 GP
Uncommon 10 days 200 GP

*The time and cost are halved for a consumable item other than 
a Spell Scroll , whose crafting time and cost are given in “Equipment.”

Sentient Magic Items
Some magic items have sentience and personality. 
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the 
spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to 
the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be 
a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in 
the side.
 Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds 
of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items 
such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.
 The GM controls sentient magic items and their 
activated properties. A bearer who maintains a 
good relationship with the item can access those 
properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict 
can ensue (see “Conflict” below).
Sentient Magic Item Traits
When you make a sentient magic item, you create 
the item’s persona much as you would create an 
NPC, with these exceptions.
Abilities
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and 
Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or de -
termine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each 
one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.
Alignment
A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator 
or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise, 
pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item’s 
Alignment table.
Communication
A sentient item communicates by sharing its emo -
tions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or 
speaking aloud. You can choose how it communi -
cates or roll on the Sentient Item’s Communication 
table.
Senses
A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to 
a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on 
the Sentient Item’s Senses table.System Reference Document 5.2.1208Special Purpose
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, 
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the 
wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special 
purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating 
from this course might cause conflict between the 
wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can 
pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item’s 
Special Purpose table.

1d100 Alignment 1d100 Alignment
01–15 Lawful Good 74–85 Chaotic Neutral

vants and interests of a particular deity.
Conflict
When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner 
opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict 
can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s 
bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus 
the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the 
item makes one or more of the following demands:
Chase My Dreams. The item demands that its 
bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of 
all other goals.
Get Rid of It. The item demands that its bearer dis -
pose of anything the item finds repugnant.
It’s Time for a Change. The item demands to be 
given to someone else.

Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3
Weapon (Any Ammunition), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2),

You have a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bo -
nus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. 
Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer 
magical.
 This ammunition is typically found or sold in 
quantities of ten or twenty pieces. Ten pieces of this 
ammunition are equivalent in value to a potion of 
the same rarity.
Ammunition of Slaying
Weapon (Any Ammunition), Very Rare 
This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures 
of a particular type, which the GM chooses or de -
termines randomly by rolling on the table below. If 
a creature of that type takes damage from the am -
munition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution 
saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage 
on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a 
successful one.
 After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the 
ammunition becomes nonmagical.

Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
While holding this Shield, you can take a Bonus 
Action to cause it to animate. The Shield leaps into 
the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if 
you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The 
Shield remains animate for 1 minute, until you take 
a Bonus Action to end this effect, or until you die or 
have the Incapacitated condition, at which point the 
Shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you 
have one free.System Reference Document 5.2.1210Apparatus of the Crab
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel 
weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden 
catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the 
catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, al -
lowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl 
inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, 
each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. 
When certain levers are used, the apparatus trans -
forms to resemble a giant lobster.
 The Apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with 
the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30 
ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren’t ex -
tended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.
 To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires 
one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the 
compartment is airtight and watertight. The com -
partment holds enough air for 10 hours of breath-
ing, divided by the number of breathing creatures 
inside.
 The apparatus floats on water. It can also go 
underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the 
vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute 
from pressure.
 A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize 
action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s 
levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back 
to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, 
functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab 
Levers table.Armor, +1, +2, or +3

Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (Requires 
Attunement)
While wearing this armor, you have Resistance to 
one of the following damage types: Bludgeoning, 
Piercing, or Slashing. The GM chooses the type or 
determines it randomly.
 Curse.  This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed 
only when the Identify  spell is cast on the armor or 
you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you 
until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or 
similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the 
curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two 
of the three damage types associated with the ar -
mor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).
Arrow-Catching Shield
Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class against ranged 
attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus 
is in addition to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.
 Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll 
against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a 
Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
Bag of Beans
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when 
found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of 
how many beans it contains and becomes a non -
magical item when it no longer contains any beans.
 If you dump one or more beans out of the bag, 
they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on 
them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the ex -
plosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including 
you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much 
damage on a successful one.
 If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt 
or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it 
produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground 
where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect 
from the following table or determine it randomly.
1d100 Effect
01 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a 
toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the 
eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution 
saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and 
have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On 
an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary 
Hit Points for 1 hour.
02–10 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, 
mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s 
choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes.1d100 Effect
11–20 A Treant  sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd 
roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even 
roll, the treant is Chaotic Good. 
21–30 An animate but immobile stone statue in 
your likeness rises and makes verbal threats 
against you. If you leave it and others come 
near, it describes you as the most heinous 
of villains and directs the newcomers to find 
and attack you. If you are on the same plane 
of existence as the statue, it knows where 
you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 
24 hours.
31–40 A campfire with green flames springs 
forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is 
extinguished.
41–50 Three Shrieker Fungi sprout.
51–60 1d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. When -
ever a toad is touched, it transforms into a 
Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice 
that acts in accordance with its alignment 
and nature. The monster remains for 1 min -
ute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink 
smoke.
61–70 A hungry Bulette  burrows up and attacks.
71–80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 
of which act as randomly determined po -
tions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked 
fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.
81–90 A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs 
springs up. Any creature that eats an egg 
makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. 
On a successful save, a creature permanently

Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
This bag resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding 
orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. 
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.
 The extradimensional creature attached to the 
bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. 
Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the 
bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a liv -
ing creature is placed in the bag, as happens when 
someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent 
chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A 
creature inside the bag can take an action to try to 
escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength 
(Athletics) check. Another creature can take an ac -
tion to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, do -
ing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) 
check, provided the puller isn’t pulled inside the bag 
first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag 
is devoured, its body destroyed.
 Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which 
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, 
once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside 
it and spits them out into another plane of existence. 
The GM determines the time and plane.
 If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and 
anything contained within it is transported to a 
random location on the Astral Plane.
Bag of Holding
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This bag has an interior space considerably larger 
than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square 
and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up 
to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic 
feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its 
contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires 
a Utilize action.
 If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is de -
stroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral 
Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents 
spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right 
before it can be used again. The bag holds enough 
air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the num -
ber of breathing creatures inside.
 Placing a Bag of Holding  inside an extradimen -
sional space created by a Handy Haversack , Portable 
Hole , or similar item instantly destroys both items 
and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate orig -
inates where the one item was placed inside the 
other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere 
centered on the gate is sucked through it to a ran -
dom location on the Astral Plane. The gate then 
closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.Bag of Tricks
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This bag made from gray, rust, or tan cloth appears 
empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals 
the presence of a small, fuzzy object.
 You can take a Magic action to pull the fuzzy ob -
ject from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When 
the object lands, it transforms into a creature you 
determine by rolling on the table that corresponds 
to the bag’s color. See “Monsters” for the creature’s 
stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn 
or when it is reduced to 0 Hit Points.
 The creature is Friendly to you and your allies, 
and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative 
count. You can take a Bonus Action to command 
how the creature moves and what action it takes on 
its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the ab -
sence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion 
appropriate to its nature.
 Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from 
the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next 
dawn.

Wondrous Item, Rare 
This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in 
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 
Beads of Force  are found together.
 You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up 
to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius 
Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature System Reference Document 5.2.1213in the Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere 
of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 
minute. Any creature that failed the save and is 
completely within the area is trapped inside this 
sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are 
partially within the area are pushed away from the 
center of the sphere until they are no longer inside 
it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s 
wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.
 An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to 
push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere 
up to half the creature’s Speed. The sphere can be 
picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 
pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

action to make it hover beneath you, at which time 
it can be ridden in the air. It has a Fly Speed of 50 
feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its Fly Speed

Candle of Invocation
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

Weapon (Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, or

You can take a Bonus Action to toss this magic 
weapon into the air. When you do so, the weapon

modifier to damage rolls.
 While the weapon hovers, you can take a Bonus 
Action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot 
within 30 feet of you. As part of the same Bonus Ac -
tion, you can cause the weapon to attack one crea-
ture within 5 feet of the weapon.
 After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth 
time, it flies back to you and tries to return to your 
hand. If you have no hand free, the weapon falls to 
the ground in your space. If the weapon has no un -

Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it 
contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.
 You can take a Magic action to remove the stopper 
and issue one of three command words, whereupon

at the start of your next turn. Choose from the fol -
lowing command words:
Splash.  The decanter produces 1 gallon of water.
Fountain.  The decanter produces 5 gallons of water.
Geyser.  The decanter produces 30 gallons of water 
that gushes forth in a Line 30 feet long and 1 foot 
wide. If you’re holding the decanter, you can aim 
the geyser in one direction (no action required). 
One creature of your choice in the Line must suc -
ceed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 
1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone con-
dition. Instead of a creature, you can target one 
object in the Line that isn’t being worn or carried 
and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The 
object is knocked over by the geyser.
Deck of Illusions
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34 
cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with 
a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usu -
ally missing 1d20 − 1 cards.

are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action 
to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself. 
An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on 
the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown

An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on 
the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown

 Any physical interaction with the illusory crea-
ture reveals it to be false, because objects pass 
through it. A creature that takes a Study action to 
visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as 
an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (In -
vestigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card 
is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel 
Magic  spell or a similar effect). When the illusion 
ends, the image on its card disappears, and that 
card can’t be used again.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon.
 The first time you attack with the weapon on each 
of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the 
weapon’s bonus to your Armor Class. For example, 
you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and 
damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to Armor 
Class. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until 
the start of your next turn, although you must hold 
the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.
Demon Armor
Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Very Rare 
(Requires Attunement)
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to 
Armor Class, and you know Abyssal. In addition, 
the armor’s clawed gauntlets allow your Unarmed 
Strikes to deal 1d8 Slashing damage instead of the 
usual Bludgeoning damage, and you gain a +1 bonus 
to the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed 
Strikes.
 Curse.  Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t 
doff it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse 
spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, 
you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against de -
mons and on saving throws against their spells and 
special abilities.
Dimensional Shackles
Wondrous Item, Rare 
You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles 
on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition. 
The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to 
Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound 
by them from using any method of extradimen -
sional movement, including teleportation or travel 
to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent 
the creature from passing through an interdimen -
sional portal.
 You and any creature you designate when you 
use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove 
them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a suc -
cessful check, the creature breaks free and destroys 
the shackles.
Dragon Orb
Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)
An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in 
diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in 
diameter, and mist swirls inside it.
 While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic 
action to peer into the orb’s depths. You must then 
make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success -
ful save, you control the orb for as long as you re -
main attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes 
the Charmed condition on you for as long as you 
remain attuned to it.
 While you are Charmed by the orb, you can’t 
voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb 
casts Suggestion  on you at will (save DC 18), urging 
you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The 
dragon essence within the orb might want many 
things: the annihilation of a particular society or or -
ganization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffer -
ing in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, 
or something else the GM decides.

 Call Dragons.  While you control the orb, you 
can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a 
telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 
miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled 
to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most 
direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are un -
affected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to 
the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling 
them against their will. Once you have used this 
property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.
 Destroying an Orb. A Dragon Orb  has AC 20 and is 
destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon  or a 
Disintegrate  spell. Nothing else can harm it.
Dragon Scale Mail
Armor (Scale Mail), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
Dragon Scale Mail  is made of the scales of one kind 
of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off System Reference Document 5.2.1219scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully 
preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, 
Dragon Scale Mail  is highly valued.
 While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to 
Armor Class, you have Advantage on saving throws 
against the breath weapons of Dragons, and you 
have Resistance to one damage type determined by 
the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the 
accompanying table).
 Additionally, you can focus your senses as a Magic 
action to discern the distance and direction to the 
closest dragon within 30 miles of yourself that is

Dust of Disappearance
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough 
of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to 
throw the dust into the air, you and each creature 
and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating 
from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 min -
utes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and 
the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. 
Immediately after an affected creature makes an at -
tack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible 
condition ends for that creature.
Dust of Dryness
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. 
As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the 
dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of 
water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats 
or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The 
pellet’s weight is negligible. A creature can take 
a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard 
surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the 
water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pel -
let and ends its magic.
 As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the 
dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Ele -
mental ). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the 
dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, tak -
ing 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as 
much damage on a successful one.
Dust of Sneezing and Choking
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
Found in a small container, this powder resembles 
Dust of Disappearance , and Identify  reveals it to be 
such. There is enough of it for one use.
 As a Utilize action, you can throw the dust into the 
air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot 
Emanation originating from you to make a DC 15 
Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, 
Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save 
automatically.

Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects 
to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver 
to hold numerous items while never weighing more 
than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold 
up to 60 Arrows, Bolts, or similar objects. The mid -

doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.System Reference Document 5.2.1220Efreeti Bottle
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
When you take a Magic action to remove the stopper 
of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke 
flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke dis -
appears with a flash of harmless fire, and an Efreeti  
appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.
 The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls on 
the following table to determine what happens.
1d10 Effect
1 The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 
rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle 
loses its magic.
2–9 The efreeti understands your languages and 
obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which 
it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper 
contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for 
24 hours. The next two times the bottle is 
opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is 
opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and 
disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.
10 The efreeti understands your languages and can 
cast Wish  once for you. It disappears when it 
grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle 
loses its magic.
Elemental Gem
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. 
When you take a Utilize action to break the gem, 
an elemental is summoned (see “Monsters” for its 
stat block), and the gem ceases to be magical. The 
elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close 
to the broken gem as possible, understands your 
languages, obeys your commands, and takes its 
turn immediately after you on your Initiative count. 
The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, 
or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The type 
of gem determines the elemental, as shown in the 
following table.

Energy Bow
Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires 
Attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon, which has no string. 
Each time you pull your arm back in a firing motion, 
a magical arrow made of golden energy appears 
nocked and ready to fire. An arrow produced by 
this weapon deals Force damage instead of Pierc -
ing damage on a hit, and it disappears after it hits 
or misses its target. Until it disappears, the arrow 
emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light 
for an additional 20 feet.
 This weapon has the following additional 
properties.
 Arrow of Restraint. Whenever you use this 
weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature, 
you can try to restrain the target instead of deal -
ing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must 
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have 
the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action, 
a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC 
20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the 
restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful 
check.
 Arrow of Transport. As a Magic action, you can 
fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target 
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target 
can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature 
or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, pro -
vided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot 
Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccu -
pied space you can see within 10 feet of you.
 Energy Ladder.  As a Magic action, you can loose a 
flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall 
up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows be -
come glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, form -
ing a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall. 
This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing. 
Eversmoking Bottle
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
As a Magic action, you can open or close this bottle.
 Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow 
out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot Emanation 
originating from the bottle. The area within the 
smoke is Heavily Obscured.
 Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of 
the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches 
its maximum size of 120 feet. System Reference Document 5.2.1221 Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become 
fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. 
A strong wind (such as that created by the Gust of 
Wind  spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.
Eyes of Charming
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 
3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 
1 or more charges to cast Charm Person  (save DC 
13). For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the 
spell. You increase the spell’s level by one for each 
additional charge you expend. The lenses regain all 
expended charges daily at dawn.
Eyes of Minute Seeing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wear -
ing them, your vision improves significantly out to a 
range of 1 foot, granting you Darkvision within that 
range and Advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) 
checks made to examine something within that 
range.
Eyes of the Eagle
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wear -
ing them, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Per -
ception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of 
clear visibility, you can make out details of even 
extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 
2 feet across.
Feather Token
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies 
This object looks like a feather. Different types of 
feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use 
effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or deter -
mines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens 
table. The type of token determines its rarity. 
 Anchor (Uncommon).  You can take a Magic action 
to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 
24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means. 
Touching the token to the vessel again ends the ef -
fect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.

the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears 
and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.

speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 
miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of 
flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird 
disappears after flying its maximum distance for a 
day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the 
bird as a Magic action. Fan (Uncommon).  If you are on a boat or ship, 
you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to 
10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant 
flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and cre -
ates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one 
ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 
hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.
 Swan Boat (Rare).  You can take a Magic action to 
touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet

water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take 
a Magic action while on the boat to command it to 
move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains 
for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss 
the boat as a Magic action.
 Tree (Uncommon).  You must be outdoors to use 
this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it 
to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token 
disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree 
springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and 
has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the 
top spread out in a 20-foot radius.
 Whip (Rare).  You can take a Magic action to 
throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself.

of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the 
target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.
 As a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly

A Figurine of Wondrous Power  is a statuette small 
enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic ac -
tion to throw the figurine to a point on the ground 
within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a 
living creature specified in the figurine’s descrip -
tion below. If the space where the creature would 
appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or System Reference Document 5.2.1222if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figu -
rine doesn’t become a creature.
 The creature is Friendly to you and your allies. 
It understands your languages, obeys your com -
mands, and takes its turn immediately after you on 
your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the 
creature defends itself but takes no other actions.
 The creature exists for a duration specific to each 
figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature 
reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine 
early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if 
you take a Magic action while touching the creature 
to make it revert to figurine form. When the crea-
ture becomes a figurine again, its property can’t 
be used again until a certain amount of time has 
passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.

 Ivory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of 
goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat 
looks unique and functions differently from the oth -
ers. Their properties are as follows:
Goat of Terror.  This figurine can become a Giant 
Goat  for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but 
you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use 
them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance, 
and the other becomes a  +2 Longsword . Removing 
a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons 
disappear and the horns return when the goat 
reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, 
any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat 
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until 
you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat 
reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature 
repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it 
succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to 
this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine 
has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days 
have passed.
Goat of Traveling.  This figurine can become a 
Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding 
Horse . It has 24 charges, and each hour or por -
tion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. 
While it has charges, you can use it as often as you 
wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a 
figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have 
passed, when it regains all expended charges.
Goat of Travail.  This figurine can become a Giant 
Goat  for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it 
can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.
 Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette 
resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an 
Elephant  for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, 
it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

sidian horse can become a Nightmare  for up to 24 
hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. 
Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 
days have passed.
 The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time 
you use it to ignore your orders, including a com -
mand to revert to figurine form. If you mount the 
nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you 
and the nightmare are instantly transported to a 
random location on the plane of Hades, where the 
nightmare reverts to figurine form.

Content: of ma-
terial, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The 
haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its 
contents.
 Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a 
Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When 
you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the 
item is always magically on top.
 If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or 
torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the 
haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, 
although an Artifact always turns up again some -
where. If the haversack is turned inside out, its con -
tents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must 
be put right before it can be used again.
 Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for 
10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of 
breathing creatures inside.
 Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Bag of Holding , Portable Hole , 
or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind 
Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in 
a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate 
then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be 
reopened.

try to cast a level 1+ spell you don’t know. The spell 
must be on the Wizard spell list, it must be of a level 
you can cast, and it can’t have Material components

the spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell’s

the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the 
spell using its normal casting time, and you can’t 
use this property again until you finish a Short or

a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check, moving the fixed 
rod up to 10 feet on a successful check.
Instant Fortress

Content: rapidly into a 
square adamantine tower. Repeating the command 
word causes the tower to revert to statuette form, 
which works only if the tower is empty. Each crea-
ture in the area where the tower appears is pushed 
to an unoccupied space outside but next to the 
tower. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or 
carried are also pushed clear of the tower.
 The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, 
with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop 
it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a lad -
der, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting 
them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trap -
door leading to the roof. When created, the tower 
has a single door at ground level on the side facing 
you. The door opens only at your command, which 
you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the 
Knock  spell and similar magic.
 Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over. 
The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20; 
HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and 
Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege 
equipment; and Resistance to all other damage. 
Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form 
doesn’t repair damage to the tower. Only a Wish 
spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell 
counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower). 
Each casting of Wish causes the tower to regain all 
its Hit Points.Ioun Stone
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)
Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones  are named after 
Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on 
some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones  exist, each 
type a distinct combination of shape and color.
 When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun 
Stone  into the air, the stone orbits your head at a 
distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you 
while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones  
orbiting your head at the same time.
 Each Ioun Stone  orbiting your head is considered 
to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone 
avoids contact with other creatures and objects, ad -
justing its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all 
attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.
 As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any 
number of Ioun Stones  orbiting your head. If your 
Attunement to an Ioun Stone  ends while it’s orbit -
ing your head, the stone falls as though you had 
dropped it.
 The type of stone determines its rarity and 
effects.
 Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender 
ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction 
to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a crea-
ture you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and 
any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the 
stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, 
turns dull gray, and loses its magic.
 Agility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity increases by 
2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere 
orbits your head.
 Awareness (Rare).  While this dark-blue rhomboid 
orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative 
rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.
 Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution in-
creases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink 
rhomboid orbits your head.
 Greater Absorption (Legendary).  While this mar -
bled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, 
you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 8 
or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled 
spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast 
it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 lev -
els of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses 
its magic.
 Insight (Very Rare).  Your Wisdom increases by 
2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue 
sphere orbits your head.
 Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence increases 
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet 
and blue sphere orbits your head.
 Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma increases 
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink 
and green sphere orbits your head.System Reference Document 5.2.1228 Mastery (Legendary).  Your Proficiency Bonus in -

 Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores 
spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. 
The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time. 
When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells 
chosen by the GM.
 Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4 
into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The 
spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the 
stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is 
expended without effect. The level of the slot used 
to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.
 While this stone orbits your head, you can cast 
any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, 
spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcast -
ing ability of the original caster but is otherwise 
treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from 
the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

Iron Bands
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diame -
ter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action 
to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature 
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere 
moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of 
metal bands.
 Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus 
equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Profi -
ciency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained 
condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a 
command that releases it. Doing so or missing with 
the attack causes the bands to contract and become 
a sphere once more.
 A creature that can touch the bands, including the 
one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20 
Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands. 
On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the 
Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any 
further attempts made by that creature automati -
cally fail until 24 hours have elapsed.
 Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again 
until the next dawn.Iron Flask
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you 
can take a Magic action to target a creature that 
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask 
is empty and the target is native to a plane of exis -
tence other than the one you’re on, the target must 
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be 
trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped 
by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save. 
Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until 
released. The flask can hold only one creature at a 
time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t age and 
doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink.
 You can take a Magic action to remove the flask’s 
stopper and release the creature in the flask. The 
creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, 
understanding those commands even if it doesn’t 
know the language in which the commands are 
given. If you issue no commands or give the crea-
ture a command that is likely to result in its death 
or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise 
takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the 
creature acts in accordance with its normal disposi -
tion and alignment.
 An Identify  spell reveals if the flask contains a 
creature, but the only way to determine the type 
of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered 
Iron Flask  might already contain a creature chosen 
by the GM.
Javelin of Lightning
Weapon (Javelin), Uncommon 
Each time you make an attack roll with this magic 
weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning dam -
age instead of Piercing damage.
 Lightning Bolt.  When you throw this weapon at 
a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can

 Lightning Bolt.  When you throw this weapon at 
a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can 
forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn

a 5-foot-wide Line between you and the target. The 
target and each other creature in the Line (exclud -
ing you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, tak -
ing 4d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half 
as much damage on a successful one. Immediately 
after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in 
your hand. This property can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
Lantern of Revealing

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 
pint of oil, shedding Bright Light in a 30-foot radius 
and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible 
creatures and objects are visible as long as they are

Attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. While the weapon is 
on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving 
throws.
 Luck. If the weapon is on your person, you can call 
on its luck (no action required) to reroll one failed 
D20 Test if you don’t have the Incapacitated condi -
tion. You must use the second roll. Once used, this 
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 Wish.  The weapon has 1d3 charges. While holding 
it, you can expend 1 charge and cast Wish from it. 
Once used, this property can’t be used again until

has no charges.
Mace of Disruption
Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)
When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic 
weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 Radiant 
damage. If the target has 25 Hit Points or fewer 
after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 
15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a suc -
cessful save, the creature has the Frightened condi -
tion until the end of your next turn.
 Light.  While you hold this weapon, it sheds Bright 
Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an addi -
tional 20 feet.
Mace of Smiting
Weapon (Mace), Rare 
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage 
rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus in -
creases to +3 when you use the weapon to attack a 
Construct.
 When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with 
this weapon, the target takes an extra 7 Bludgeon -
ing damage, or 14 Bludgeoning damage if it’s a 
Construct. If a Construct has 25 Hit Points or fewer 
after taking this damage, it is destroyed.
Mace of Terror
Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)
This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3 
expended charges daily at dawn. While holding 
the weapon, you can take a Magic action and ex -
pend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. 
Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you 
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or 
have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While Frightened in this way, a creature must spend its 
turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, 
and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks. For its ac -
tion, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape 
from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it 
has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the 
Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a crea-
ture repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on 
a success.
Mantle of Spell Resistance
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
You have Advantage on saving throws against spells

Manual of Golems
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
This tome contains information and incantations 
necessary to make a particular type of golem. The 
GM chooses the type or determines it randomly by 
rolling on the accompanying table. To decipher and 
use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at 
least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can’t 
use a Manual of Golems  and attempts to read it takes 
6d6 Psychic damage.
 To create a golem, you must spend the time shown 
on the table, working without interruption with the 
manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours 
per day. You must also pay the specified cost to pur -
chase supplies.
 Once you finish creating the golem, the book is 
consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes 
animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled 
on it. See “Monsters” for the golem’s stat block. The 
golem is under your control, and it understands and 
obeys your commands.System Reference Document 5.2.12301d20 Golem Time Cost

Marvelous Pigments
Wondrous Item, Very Rare 
This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment 
and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).
 Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, 
you can paint any number of three-dimensional 
objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, 
trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided 
these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. 
The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the num -
ber of elements you create), during which time you 
must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentra-
tion. If your Concentration is broken or you leave 
the Cube before the work is done, all the painted 
elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.
 When the work is done, all the painted objects 
and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a 
door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be 
opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates 
a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within 
the 20-foot Cube.
 No object created by a pot of pigment can have a 
value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all 
objects created by a pot of pigment can’t exceed 500 
GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a 
large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close in -
spection reveals they’re made from paste, cookies, 
or some other worthless material.
 If you paint a form of energy such as fire or light -
ning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete 
the painting, doing no harm.
Medallion of Thoughts
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
The medallion has 5 charges. While wearing it, you 
can expend 1 charge to cast Detect Thoughts  (save 
DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d4 expended 
charges daily at dawn.Mirror of Life Trapping

 If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and

Content: images of crea-
tures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 
11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage, 
and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shat -
ters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.
 If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and 
you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic 
action and use a command word to activate it. It 
remains activated until you take a Magic action and 
repeat the command word to deactivate it.
 Any creature other than you that sees its reflec -
tion in the activated mirror while within 30 feet 
of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma 
saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it 
is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve 
extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the 
mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage, 
and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.
 An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse 
filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 
feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t 
age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A 
creature trapped within a cell can escape using 
magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the 
creature is confined to the cell until freed.
  If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve ex -
tradimensional cells are already occupied, the mir -
ror frees one trapped creature at random to accom -
modate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears 
in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror 
but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, 
all creatures it contains are freed and appear in un -
occupied spaces near it.
 While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a 
Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or 
call out a particular cell by number. The creature 
named or contained in the named cell appears as an 
image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature 
can then communicate.
 In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and 
use a second command word to free one creature 
trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, 
along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space 
nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.
 Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Bag of Holding , Portable Hole , 
or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind 
Total Cover is sucked through it to a random loca-
tion on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The 
gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.System Reference Document 5.2.1231Mithral Armor

Uncommon 
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this

Mysterious Deck
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains 
a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most 
(75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but 
some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column 
of the Mysterious Deck table when randomly deter -
mining cards drawn from the deck.
 Before you draw a card, you must declare how 
many cards you intend to draw and then draw them 
randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this num -
ber have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a 
card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must 
draw each card no more than 1 hour after the pre -
vious draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, 
the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on 
their own and take effect all at once.
 Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the 
card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the 
deck, making it possible to draw the same card 
twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, re -
roll on the table if that card comes up again.)

 Each card’s effect is described below.
 Balance.  You can increase one of your ability 
scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also 
decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. 
You can’t decrease an ability that has a score of 5 
or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to ad -
just your ability scores, in which case this card has 
no effect.
 Comet.  The next time you enter combat against 
one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one 
of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you 
reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, 
you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 
year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 
Hit Points or you don’t choose a foe, this card has no 
effect.
 Donjon.  You disappear and become entombed 
in a state of suspended animation in an extradi -
mensional sphere. Everything you’re wearing and 
carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, 
which stay behind in the space you occupied when 
you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you 
are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t 
be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell 
can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no 
more cards.
 Euryale.  The card’s medusa-like visage curses 
you. You take a −2 penalty to saving throws while 
cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the 
Fates card can end this curse.
 Fates.  Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, al -
lowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never 
happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon 
as you draw the card or at any other time before 
you die.
 Flames.  A powerful devil becomes your enemy. 
The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savor -
ing your suffering before attempting to slay you. 
This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.
 Fool.  You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the 
next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn’t 
count as one of your declared draws.
 Gem.  Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 
GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at 
your feet.System Reference Document 5.2.1232 Jester.  You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the 
next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards 
beyond your declared draws.
 Key.  A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which 
you are proficient appears on your person. The GM 
chooses the weapon.
 Knight.  You gain the service of a Knight , who 
magically appears in an unoccupied space you 
choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the 
same alignment as you and serves you loyally until 
death, believing the two of you have been drawn to -
gether by fate. Work with your GM to create a name 
and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a differ -
ent stat block to represent the knight, as desired.
 Moon.  You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.
 Puzzle. Permanently reduce your Intelligence or 
Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You 
can draw one additional card beyond your declared 
draws.
 Rogue.  An NPC of the GM’s choice becomes Hostile 
toward you. You don’t know the identity of this NPC 
until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less 
than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the 
NPC’s hostility toward you.
 Ruin.  All forms of wealth that you carry or own, 
other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable 
property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land 
you own are lost in a way that alters reality the 
least. Any documentation that proves you should 
own something lost to this card also disappears.
 Sage.  At any time you choose within one year of 
drawing this card, you can ask a question in medita-
tion and mentally receive a truthful answer to that 
question.
 Skull.  An Avatar of Death  (see the accompanying 
stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close 
to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with 
its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a 
tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. 
The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points 
or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the 
avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of

Content: choose within one year of 
drawing this card, you can ask a question in medita-

 Skull.  An Avatar of Death  (see the accompanying 
stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close 
to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with 
its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a 
tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. 
The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points 
or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the 
avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death . 
The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as

draw. A creature slain by an avatar can’t be restored 
to life.

your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit

disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish 
instead.
 Throne.  You gain proficiency and Expertise in 
your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Per -

a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the 
keep is currently home to one or more monsters, 
which must be cleared out before you can claim the 
keep as yours.
 Void.  Your soul is drawn from your body and 
contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. 
One or more powerful beings guard the place. While 
your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, 
ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A 
Wish spell can’t return your soul to your body, but 
the spell reveals the location of the object that holds 
your soul. You draw no more cards.

Wondrous Item, Rare 
This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it.

bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.

d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed 
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain 
instantly as the sword tears its life force from its

remaining, it loses this property.Oathbow
Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires 
Attunement)
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in 
Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use 
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter 
or sign the following command words: “Swift death 
to you who have wronged me.” The target of your 
attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or 
until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such 
sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy 
dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.
 When you make a ranged attack roll with this 
weapon against your sworn enemy, you have Ad -
vantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no 
benefit from Half Cover or Three-Quarters Cover, 
and you suffer no Disadvantage due to long range. 
If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 
3d6 Piercing damage.
 While your sworn enemy lives, you have Disad -
vantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.
Oil of Etherealness
Potion, Rare 
One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller 
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and 
carrying (one additional vial is required for each 
size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes

One vial of this oil can coat one Melee weapon or 
twenty pieces of ammunition, but only ammunition 
and Melee weapons that are nonmagical and deal

into +3 Ammunition .

ultrathin silver shards.

Potion, Uncommon 
One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller 
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and 
carrying (one additional vial is required for each

as a Magic action, where it covers a 10-foot square, System Reference Document 5.2.1234duplicating the effect of the Grease  spell in that area 
for 8 hours.

Periapt of Wound Closure
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this pendant, you gain the following 
benefits.
 Life Preservation. Whenever you make a Death 
Saving Throw, you can change a roll of 9 or lower to 
a 10, turning a failed save into a successful one.
 Natural Healing Boost.  Whenever you roll a Hit 
Point Die to regain Hit Points, double the number of 
Hit Points it restores.
Philter of Love
Potion, Uncommon 
The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes 
after drinking this philter, you are charmed by that 
creature and have the Charmed condition for 1 
hour.
 This rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one 
easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
Pipes of Haunting
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 ex -
pended charges daily at dawn. You can take a Magic 
action to play them and expend 1 charge to create 
an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your 
choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 
15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened 
condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the 
effect on itself on a success. A creature that suc -
ceeds on its save is immune to the effect of these 
pipes for 24 hours.
Pipes of the Sewers
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats 
and giant rats are Indifferent toward you and won’t 
attack you unless you threaten or harm them.
 The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 ex -
pended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes 
as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to 
expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm 
of Rats  with each expended charge if enough rats 
are within half a mile of you to be called in this 
fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t 
enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. 
Called swarms move toward the music by the short -
est available route but aren’t under your control 
otherwise.
 Whenever a Swarm of Rats  that isn’t under an -
other creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you 
while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes 
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful 
save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and 
can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 
hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the 
pipes’ music and becomes Friendly to you and your 
allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes 
each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm 
obeys your commands. If you issue no commands 
to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise 
takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn 
more than 30 feet away from you, your control over 
that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it nor -
mally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ mu -
sic for the next 24 hours.
Plate Armor of Etherealness
Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Legendary 
(Requires Attunement)
While you’re wearing this armor, you can take a 
Magic action and use a command word to gain the 
effect of the Etherealness  spell. The spell ends imme -
diately if you remove the armor or take a Magic ac -
tion to repeat the command word. This property of 
the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.
Portable Hole
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the 
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a cir -
cular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
 You can take a Magic action to unfold a Por -
table Hole  and place it on or against a solid sur -
face, whereupon the Portable Hole  creates an System Reference Document 5.2.1235extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical 
space within the hole exists on a different plane 
of existence, so it can’t be used to create open pas -
sages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole  
can exit the hole by climbing out of it.
 You can take a Magic action to close a Portable 
Hole  by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and 
folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and 
any creatures or objects within remain in the ex -
tradimensional space. No matter what’s in

Content: Portable Hole  creates an System Reference Document 5.2.1235extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical 
space within the hole exists on a different plane 
of existence, so it can’t be used to create open pas -
sages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole  
can exit the hole by climbing out of it.
 You can take a Magic action to close a Portable 
Hole  by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and 
folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and 
any creatures or objects within remain in the ex -
tradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the 
hole weighs next to nothing.
 If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s 
extradimensional space can take an action to make 
a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful 
check, the creature forces its way out and appears 
within 5 feet of the Portable Hole . A closed Portable 
Hole  holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, di -
vided by the number of breathing creatures inside.
 Placing a Portable Hole  inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Bag of Holding , Handy Haversack , 
or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any

Rod of Absorption
Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to 
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn’t 
create an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect 
is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell it -
self—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same 
level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell 
dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to 
cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up 
to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. 
Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t ab -
sorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod 
can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.
 When you become attuned to the rod, you know 
how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed 
over the course of its existence and how many levels 
of spell energy it currently has stored.
 If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can 
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast 
spells you have prepared or know. You can create 
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your 
own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use 
the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise 
cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 
levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.
 A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of 
spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer 
absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining 
becomes nonmagical.
Rod of Alertness
Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
This rod has the following properties.
 Alertness.  While holding the rod, you have 
Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on 
Initiative rolls.
 Spells. While holding the rod, you can cast the fol -
lowing spells from it:
• Detect Evil and Good
• Detect Magic
• Detect Poison and Disease
• See Invisibility
 Protective Aura.  As a Magic action, you can plant 
the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon 
the rod’s head sheds Bright Light in a 60-foot radius 
and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in 
that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can 
sense the location of any Invisible creature that is 
also in the Bright Light.
 The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends 
after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic 
action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, 
this property can’t be used again until the next 
dawn.
Rod of Lordly Might
Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a 
magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls 
and damage rolls made with it. The rod has proper -
ties associated with six different buttons that are 
set in a row along the haft. It has three other prop -
erties as well, detailed below.
 Buttons.  You can press one of the following but -
tons as a Bonus Action; a button’s effect lasts until 
you push a different button or until you push the 
same button again, which causes the rod to revert 
to its normal form:
Button 1.  A fiery blade sprouts from the end op -
posite the rod’s flanged head. The flames shed 
Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for 
an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as 
a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) 
that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.
Button 2.  The rod’s flanged head folds down and 
two crescent-shaped blades spring out, trans -
forming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants 
a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made 
with it.
Button 3.  The rod’s flanged head folds down, a 
spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the 
rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, trans -
forming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a 
+3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made 
with it.
Button 4.  The rod transforms into a climbing pole 
up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though 
the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In 
surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bot -
tom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole.

sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can

up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though

Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the 
sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can 
bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of 
solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its 
normal form.
Button 5.  The rod transforms into a handheld 
battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus 
to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break 
through doors, barricades, and other barriers.
Button 6.  The rod assumes or remains in its nor -
mal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing 
happens if this function of the rod is used in a System Reference Document 5.2.1242location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also 
gives you knowledge of your approximate depth 
beneath the ground or your height above it.
 Drain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee 
attack using the rod, you can force the target to 
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed 
save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic dam -
age, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to 
half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property 
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
 Paralyze.  When you hit a creature with a melee 
attack using the rod, you can force the target to 
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed 
save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1 
minute. The target repeats the save at the end of 
each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. 
Once used, this property can’t be used again until 
the next dawn.
 Terrify.  While holding the rod, you can take a 
Magic action to force each creature you can see 
within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom 
saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the 
Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened 
target repeats the save at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once 
used, this property can’t be used again until the 
next dawn.
Rod of Resurrection
Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)
The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can 
cast one of the following spells from it: Heal  (ex-
pends 1 charge) or Resurrection  (expends 5 charges).
 The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. 
If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the 
rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.
Rod of Rulership
Rod, Rare (Requires Attunement)
You can take a Magic action to present the rod and 
command obedience from each creature of your 
choice that you can see within 120 feet of your -
self. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom 
saving throw or have the Charmed condition for 8 
hours. While Charmed in this way, the creature re -
gards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or 
your allies or commanded to do something contrary 
to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this 
way. Once used, this property can’t be used again 
until the next dawn.
Rod of Security
Rod, Very Rare 
While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action 
to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you 
and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see 
to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern, 
an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic car -
nival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless 
of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water 
and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane’s 
environment can’t harm its occupants. Everything 
else that can be interacted with there can exist 
only there. For example, a flower picked from a 
garden there disappears if it is taken outside the 
demiplane.
 For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor 
regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die. 
Also, creatures don’t age while there, although time 
passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to 
200 days divided by the number of creatures pres -
ent (round down).
 When the time runs out or you take a Magic action 
to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the loca-
tion they occupied when you activated the rod or an 
unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used, 
this property can’t be used again until 10

Rope of Climbing
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000 
pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can 
take a Magic action to command the other end of the 
rope to animate and move toward a destination you 
choose, up to the rope’s length away from you. That 
end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first com -
mand it and 10 feet at the start of each of your sub -
sequent turns until reaching its destination or until 
you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten 
itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to 
knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.
 If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 
1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the 
rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advan -
tage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.
 The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poi -
son and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the 
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.
Rope of Entanglement
Wondrous Item, Rare 
This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of 
the rope, you can take a Magic action to command 
the other end to dart forward and entangle one 
creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The 
target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving 
throw or have the Restrained condition. You can re -
lease the target by letting go of your end of the rope 
(causing the rope to coil up in the target’s space) 
or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command 
(causing the rope to coil up in your hand).System Reference Document 5.2.1243 A target Restrained by the rope can take an action 
to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or 
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check, 
the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If 
you’re still holding onto the rope when a target es -
capes from it, you can take a Reaction to command 
the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope 
coils up in the target’s space. 
 The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poi -
son and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every 
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the 
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.

carved to match the other so the pairing is easily 
recognized. While you touch one stone, you can cast 
Sending  from it. The target is the bearer of the other 
stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you 
know that fact as soon as you use the stone, and you 
don’t cast the spell.

can’t be used again until the next dawn. If one of the 
stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes 
nonmagical.

 Curse.  This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses 
you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell 
or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to

Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet 
of you, the curse causes you to become the target 
instead.

Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)
While holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to 
Armor Class. This bonus is in addition to the Shield’s 
normal bonus to AC.
 The Shield has the following additional properties 
that you can use while holding it.
 Forceful Bash . When you take the Attack action, 
you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield 
against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your 
Proficiency Bonus and Strength modifier to the at -
tack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to 
the target equal to 2d6 + 2 plus your Strength mod -
ifier, and if the target is a creature, you can push 
it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the 
creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock 
it down, giving it the Prone condition.
 Protective Field. As a Reaction, when you or an 
ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by 
an attack or makes a saving throw against an area 
of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immo -
bile 5-foot Emanation originating from you. When 
the Emanation appears, any creatures or objects not 
fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest 
unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of 
effect that triggered the Reaction has no effect on 
creatures and objects inside the Emanation, which 
lasts as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1 
minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emana-
tion. A creature or object inside the Emanation can’t 
be damaged by attacks or effects originating from 
outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation 
damage anything outside it. Once this property is 
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.System Reference Document 5.2.1244Slippers of Spider Climbing

Spell Scroll
Scroll, Rarity Varies 
A Spell Scroll  bears the words of a single spell, writ -
ten in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your spell 
list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell with -
out Material components. Otherwise, the scroll is 
unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll 
requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the 
spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the cast -
ing is interrupted, the scroll isn’t lost.
 If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level 
than you can normally cast, you make an ability 
check using your spellcasting ability to determine 
whether you cast the spell. The DC equals 10 plus 
the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disap -
pears from the scroll with no other effect.
 The level of the spell on the scroll determines the 
spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as 
the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the following table.

on a Spell Scroll  can be copied into a spellbook. 
When a spell is copied in this way, the copier must

Sphere of Annihilation
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the 
multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a 
magical field surrounding it.
 The sphere obliterates all matter it passes 
through and all matter that passes through it. Ar -
tifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is sus -
ceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation , it 
passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else 
that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed 
and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.
 Controlling the Sphere. A Sphere of Annihilation  is 
stationary until someone takes control of it. If you 
are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic 
action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. 
On a successful check, you control the sphere until 
the start of your next turn, and if it was under an -
other creature’s control, that creature loses control 
of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 
10 feet toward you in a straight line. 
 While in control of the sphere, you can take a 
Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction 
of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 
5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 
feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters 
must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw 
or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A 
creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is 
obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no 
other physical remains.
 Sphere Interactions.  If the sphere comes into 
contact with a planar portal (such as that created by 
the Gate  spell) or an extradimensional space (such 
as that within a Portable Hole ), the GM determines 
randomly what happens using the following table.System Reference Document 5.2.12451d100 Result
01–50 The sphere is destroyed.
51–85 The sphere moves through the portal or into 
the extradimensional space.

ture and object within 180 feet of the sphere 
to a random plane of existence.

point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a 
1–2, Darkness ; on a 3–4, Faerie Fire ; on a 5–6, 
Fireball; on a 7–8, Slow; on a 9–10,  Stinking 
Cloud .
21–25 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, you have the Stunned condition until 
the start of your next turn, believing some -
thing awesome just happened.
26–30 You cast Gust of Wind . The Line created by the 
spell extends from you to the chosen point of 
origin.
31–35 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage.
36–40 Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foot-
high, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the 
chosen point of origin. During that time, the 
area of effect is Lightly Obscured.
41–45 A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 
60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered 
on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies 
remain for 10 minutes, during which time the 
area of effect is Heavily Obscured.
46–50 You cast Lightning Bolt . The Line created by the 
spell extends from you to the chosen point of 
origin.
51–55 The creature closest to the chosen point of 
origin is enlarged as if you had cast Enlarge/
Reduce  on it. If the target isn’t you and can’t be 
affected by that spell, you become the target 
instead.
56–60 A magically formed creature appears in an 
unoccupied space as close to the chosen point 
of origin as possible. The creature isn’t under 
your control, acts as it normally would, and 
disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 
Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which crea -
ture appears. On a 1, a Rhinoceros  appears; 
on a 2,  an Elephant  appears; and on a 3–4, a 
Rat appears.
61–64 Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground, 
with the center of that circle as close to the 
chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that’s 
already there grows to ten times its normal 
size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.1d100 Effect
65–68 An object of the GM’s choice disappears into 
the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither 
worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the cho -
sen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet 
in any dimension. If there are no such objects 
in range, nothing happens.
69–72 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, you shrink as if you had cast Enlarge/
Reduce  on yourself and remain in that state for 
1 minute.
73–77 Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the 
chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked 
off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 
hours.
78–82 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light 
extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation. 
Each creature in the area must succeed on a 
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the 
Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature re -
peats the save at the end of each of its turns, 
ending the effect on itself on a success.
83–87 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, you cast Invisibility  on yourself.
88–92 Nothing happens at the chosen point of ori -
gin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each 
worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand’s tip in a 
Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the 
chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Blud -
geoning damage, and the total damage of the 
gems is divided equally among all creatures in 
the Line.

Content: on itself on a success.
83–87 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. 
Instead, you cast Invisibility  on yourself.
88–92 Nothing happens at the chosen point of ori -
gin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each 
worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand’s tip in a 
Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the 
chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Blud -
geoning damage, and the total damage of the 
gems is divided equally among all creatures in 
the Line.
93–97 You cast Polymorph , targeting the creature 
closest to the chosen point of origin. Roll 1d4 
to determine the target’s new form. On a 1, 
the new form is a Black Bear;  on a 2, the 
new form is a Giant Wasp;  on a 3–4, the new 
form is a Frog.
98–00 The creature closest to the chosen point of 
origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature has the 
Restrained condition and begins to turn to 
stone. While Restrained in this way, the crea -
ture repeats the save at the end of its next 
turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. 
On a failed save, the creature has the Petrified 
condition instead of the Restrained condition. 
The petrification lasts until the creature is 
freed by the Greater Restoration  spell or similar 
magic.System Reference Document 5.2.1253Weapon, +1, +2, or +3
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Uncommon (+1), Rare 
(+2), or Very Rare (+3) 
You have a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls 
made with this magic weapon. The bonus is deter -
mined by the weapon’s rarity.
Weapon of Warning
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Uncommon (Requires 
Attunement)
As long as this weapon is within your reach and you 
are attuned to it, you and allies within 30 feet of you 
gain the following benefits.
 Alarm.  The weapon magically awakens each sub -
ject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. 
This benefit doesn’t wake a subject from magically 
induced sleep.
 Supernatural Readiness.  Each subject has Advan -
tage on its Initiative rolls.
Well of Many Worlds
Wondrous Item, Legendary 
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the 
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a cir -
cular sheet 6 feet in diameter.
 You can take a Magic action to unfold the Well of 
Many Worlds  and place it on a solid surface, where -
upon it forms a two-way, 6-foot-diameter, circular 
portal to another world or plane of existence. Each 
time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where 
it leads. The portal remains open until a creature 
within 5 feet of it takes a Magic action to close it 
by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding 
it up.
 Once the Well of Many Worlds has opened a portal, 
it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.Wind Fan
Wondrous Item, Uncommon 
While holding this fan, you can cast Gust of Wind 
(save DC 13) from it. Each subsequent time the fan 
is used before the next dawn, it has a cumulative 
20 percent chance of not working; if the fan fails to 
work, it tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.
Winged Boots
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
These boots have 4 charges and regain 1d4 ex -
pended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the 
boots, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 
charge, gaining a Fly Speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. If 
you are flying when the duration expires, you de -
scend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.
Wings of Flying
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)
While wearing this cloak, you can take a Magic ac -
tion to turn the cloak into a pair of wings on your 
back. The wings lasts for 1 hour or until you end the 
effect early as a Magic action. The wings give you a 
Fly Speed of 60 feet. If you are aloft when the wings 
disappear, you fall. When the wings disappear, you 
can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.254

Parts of a Stat Block
The rules for a stat block are detailed in “Rules Glos -
sary”  and in this section.
Size
A monster is Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, 
or Gargantuan. If size options are presented, you 
choose the creature’s size from those options. See 
“Playing the Game” for information on size.
Creature Type
Each monster has a tag that identifies the type of 
creature it is. Certain spells, magic items, class fea-
tures, and other effects in the game interact in spe -
cial ways with creatures of a particular type.
 The game includes the following creature types, 
which have no rules of their own:
Aberrations  are utterly alien beings, such as abo -
leths and cloakers.
Beasts  are non-Humanoid natural creatures, like 
horses and wolves, as well as most giant animals.
Celestials are magical creatures, such as angels and 
pegasi, with ties to the Upper Planes.
Constructs  are magically created creatures such as 
homunculi and shield guardians.
Dragons  are scaly beings of ancient origin, such as 
red dragons and wyverns.Elementals  are beings from the Elemental Planes, 
such as efreet and water elementals.
Fey are creatures tied to the Feywild or the forces 
of nature, such as dryads and goblins.
Fiends are creatures tied to terrifying Lower 
Planes, such as balors and hell hounds.
Giants  are towering beings with humanlike shapes, 
like fire giants and trolls.
Humanoids  are people defined by their roles and 
professions, such as mages, pirates, and warriors. 
They include members of varied species.
Monstrosities  are unnatural creatures with 
strange origins, such as mimics and owlbears.
Oozes  are gelatinous creatures, including black 
puddings and gelatinous cubes.
Plants  are sentient vegetation and fungal monsters, 
such as shambling mounds and treants.
Undead are spirits and the reanimated dead, such 
as ghosts, vampires, and zombies.
Descriptive Tags
A monster might have one or more tags in parenthe -
ses following its type. Such tags provide additional 
categorization and have no rules of their own, but 
certain game effects might refer to them.
Alignment
The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is 
a default suggestion of how to roleplay the monster, 
inspired by its traditional role in the game or real- 
world folklore. Change a monster’s alignment to 
suit your storytelling needs. The Neutral alignment, 
in particular, is an invitation for you to consider 
whether an individual leans toward one of the other 
alignments.
 “Character Creation”  describes the nine align -
ments and unaligned creatures.
Armor Class
A monster’s Armor Class (AC) includes its natural 
armor, Dexterity, gear, and other defenses. See 
“Playing the Game” for information on Armor Class.
Initiative
The Initiative entry specifies the monster’s Initia-
tive modifier followed by the monster’s Initiative 
score in parentheses. Use the modifier when you 
roll to determine a monster’s Initiative. A monster’s 
Initiative modifier is typically equal to its Dexterity 
modifier, but some monsters have additional mod -
ifiers, such as Proficiency Bonus, applied to that 
number.
 If you don’t want to roll a monster’s Initiative, use 
the Initiative score as the monster’s Initiative in 
combat. Initiative is further detailed in “Playing the 
Game .”255
System Reference Document 5.2.1
Running  a Monste R
To ensure a monster acts in accordance with its 
Challenge Rating, follow these rules during combat:
Special Abilities. If the monster has a special abil -
ity that deals a lot of damage but has a limited 
number of uses, such as a recharging breath 
weapon or a spell it can cast only once per day, 
have it use that special ability as quickly and as 
often as possible.
Multiattack.  If the monster has Multiattack, have 
it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which 
it’s not using one of its more powerful abilities.
Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions. If 
the monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions, or 
Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it 
uses them as often as it can.Hit Points
A monster’s Hit Points are presented as a number 
followed by parentheses, where the monster’s Hit 
Point Dice are provided, along with any contribu -
tion from its Constitution. Either use the number for 
the monster’s Hit Points or roll the die expression in 
parentheses

==================================================

--- Chunk 525 ---
Content: as possible.
Multiattack.  If the monster has Multiattack, have 
it use Multiattack on any of its turns in which 
it’s not using one of its more powerful abilities.
Bonus Actions, Reactions, Legendary Actions. If 
the monster has Bonus Actions, Reactions, or 
Legendary Actions in its stat block, make sure it 
uses them as often as it can.Hit Points
A monster’s Hit Points are presented as a number 
followed by parentheses, where the monster’s Hit 
Point Dice are provided, along with any contribu -
tion from its Constitution. Either use the number for 
the monster’s Hit Points or roll the die expression in 
parentheses to determine the monster’s Hit Points 
randomly; don’t use both.
 A monster’s size typically determines the die used 
to calculate its Hit Points, as shown in the Hit Dice 
by Size table.
Hit Dice by Size
Monster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die
Tiny d4 2½
Small d6 3½
Medium d8 4½
Large d10 5½
Huge d12 6½
Gargantuan d20 10½
A monster’s Constitution modifier is multiplied by 
the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result 
is added to its Hit Points. For example, if a monster 
has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit 
Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 Hit Points (average 11).
 For more on Hit Points, see “Playing the Game .”
Speed
The Speed entry specifies a monster’s Speed. Some 
monsters have one or more of the following speeds: 
Burrow, Climb, Fly, Swim. Rules for Speed and these 
specials speeds appear in “Rules Glossary .”
Ability Scores
Every monster has six ability scores along with 
corresponding ability score modifiers and saving 
throw modifiers. For more information on ability 
scores and saving throws, see “Playing the Game .”
Skills
The Skills entry specifies a monster’s skill profi -
ciencies, if any. For example, a monster that is very 
perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wis -
dom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. A 
skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability 
modifier and its Proficiency Bonus. Other modifiers 
might apply.
Resistances and Vulnerabilities
These entries list a monster’s Resistances and Vul -
nerabilities, if any. See “Playing the Game” for more 
information.Immunities
This entry lists the monster’s Immunities, if any. If 
the monster has damage and condition Immunities, 
the damage types are listed before the conditions. 
See “Playing the Game” for details.
Gear
Monsters have proficiency with their equipment. If 
a monster has equipment that can be given away or 
retrieved, the items are listed in the Gear entry. The 
monster’s stat block might include special flour -
ishes that happen when the monster uses an item, 
and the stat block might ignore the rules in “Equip -
ment” for that item. When used by someone else, a 
retrievable item uses its “Equipment” rules, ignor -
ing any special flourishes in the stat block.
 The Gear entry doesn’t necessarily list all of a 
monster’s equipment. For example, a monster that 
wears clothes is assumed to be dressed appropri -
ately, and those clothes aren’t in this entry.
 Equipment mentioned outside the Gear entry is 
considered to be supernatural or highly specialized, 
and it is unusable when the monster is defeated.
Ammunition and Ranged Attacks
A monster that requires ammunition to make 
ranged attacks carries the necessary ammunition.
Equipping a Monster with Other Items
You may equip monsters with additional gear how -
ever you like, using the items in “Equipment” for 
inspiration. You decide how much of a monster’s 
equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain 
and whether any of that equipment is still usable.
 Beware of giving a monster combat-oriented 
magic items, since those might alter the monster’s 
Challenge Rating. If you do give a monster a magic 
item, the monster can have Attunement with magic 
items as noted in “Equipment.” A monster with 256
System Reference Document 5.2.1a class tag after its creature type is considered a 
member of that class for Attunement purposes.
Senses
The Senses entry specifies a monster’s Passive 
Perception score, as well as any special senses the 
monster possesses. Passive Perception and special 
senses are described in “Rules Glossary .”
Languages
This entry lists languages that the monster can use 
to communicate. Sometimes a monster can under -
stand a language but can’t communicate with it, 
which is noted in its entry. “None” indicates that a 
creature doesn’t comprehend any language.
Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature 
to communicate mentally with another creature 
within a specified range. See “Rules Glossary” for 
more information.
Challenge Rating
Challenge Rating is defined in “Rules Glossary,” 
while guidance on using CR to plan potential com -
bat encounters is in “Gameplay Toolbox.”
Experience Points
The number of Experience Points (XP) a monster 
is worth is based on its CR, as detailed in the Ex -
perience Points by Challenge Rating table. XP is 
awarded for defeating the monster in combat or 
otherwise neutralizing it.
 Unless a rule says otherwise, a monster sum -
moned by a spell or another magical ability is worth

Traits
A monster’s traits, if any, are features that are ac -
tive at all times or in certain situations.
Actions
A monster can take the actions in this section or 
take one of the actions available to all creatures, as 
described in “Playing the Game.”
Attack Notation
The entry for a monster’s attack identifies whether 
the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then 
provides the attack roll’s bonus, its reach or range, 
and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one 
target unless its entry says otherwise. For details 
on different kinds of attacks, see “Playing the Game” 
and “Spells.”
 Hit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur 
as a result of an attack hitting a target are described 
after the “ Hit:” notation.
 Miss.  If an attack has an effect that occurs on a 
miss, that information follows the “ Miss: ” notation.
 Hit or Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs 
regardless of whether it hits or misses its target, 
that information follows the “ Hit or Miss: ” notation.
Saving Throw Effect Notation
If an effect forces a saving throw, the effect identi -
fies the kind of save required and then provides the 
save’s DC, a description of which creatures make 
the save, and an explanation of what happens on a 
failed or successful save.
 “Half damage only” on a successful save means 
the target takes half as much damage (round down) 
as targets that fail the save, while also ignoring all 
other parts of the effect.257
System Reference Document 5.2.1Damage Notation
A stat block usually provides both a number and a 
die expression for each instance of damage. For ex -
ample, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a 
hit. You decide whether to use the number or the die 
expression in parentheses; don’t use both.
Multiattack
Some creatures can make more than one attack 
when they take the Attack action. Such creatures 
have the Multiattack entry in the “Actions” section 
of their stat block. This entry details the attacks a 
creature can make, as well as any additional abili -
ties it can use, as part of the Attack action.
Spellcasting
If a monster can cast any spells, its stat block lists 
the spells and provides the monster’s spellcasting 
ability, spell save DC (if any spells require a saving 
throw), and spell attack bonus (if any spells require 
an attack roll). Unless noted otherwise, a spell of 
level 1 or higher is always cast at its lowest possible 
level and can’t be cast at a higher level.
 A monster’s spell can have special rules or restric -
tions. For example, a green hag can cast the Invisi -
bility  spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, 
which means the spell affects only the hag. 
 Spell Components.  The Spellcasting trait notes 
whether the monster’s spellcasting ignores the 
need for certain spell components. If any spell com -
ponents are required, describe the monster’s use of 
Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to 
characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that 
requires Material components has them.
 Casting Times of 1+ Minutes. If a spell has a cast -
ing time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spell -
casting action, the monster doesn’t cast the spell in 
just one action unless the action’s description states 
otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action 
on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to 
cast the spell, as described in “Rules

Content: If any spell com -
ponents are required, describe the monster’s use of 
Verbal, Somatic, or Material components to signal to 
characters that it is casting a spell. A monster that 
requires Material components has them.
 Casting Times of 1+ Minutes. If a spell has a cast -
ing time of 1 minute or more yet is listed in a spell -
casting action, the monster doesn’t cast the spell in 
just one action unless the action’s description states 
otherwise; the monster must take the Magic action 
on each of its turns and maintain Concentration to 
cast the spell, as described in “Rules Glossary.”
Bonus Action
If a monster has Bonus Action options, they are 
listed in this section. See “Playing the Game” for de -
tails on Bonus Actions.Reactions
If the monster has Reaction options, those are listed 
in this section along with their triggers. See “Play -
ing the Game” for details on Reactions.
Legendary Actions
If the monster has Legendary Action options, those 
are listed in this section. A Legendary Action is an 
action that a monster can take immediately after 
another creature’s turn. Only one of these actions 
can be taken at a time and only after another crea-
ture’s turn ends. The monster can’t take a Legend -
ary Action if it has the Incapacitated condition or is 
otherwise unable to take actions.
 The monster has a limited number of Legendary 
Action uses, and that number is specified in the 
stat block. The monster expends one use whenever 
it takes a Legendary Action, and it regains all ex -
pended uses at the start of each of its turns.
Limited Usage
Some parts of a stat block have restrictions on the 
number of times they can be used. Here are the 
most common ways that usage is limited:
X/Day.  This notation means the stat block part can 
be used a certain number of times (represented 
by X) and that a monster must finish a Long Rest 
to regain expended uses. For example, a Reaction 
that includes “1/Day” means the Reaction can be 
taken once and that the monster must finish a 
Long Rest to take it again.
Recharge X–Y.  This notation means a monster 
can use the stat block part once. At the start of 
each of the monster’s turns, roll 1d6. If the roll 
is within the number range given in the notation 
(represented by X–Y), the monster regains the use 
of that part, which also recharges when the mon -
ster finishes a Short or Long Rest. For example, 
“Recharge 5–6” in an action means a monster can 
take the action once. Then, at the start of each of 
the monster’s turns, it regains the use of that ac -
tion if it rolls a 5 or 6 on 1d6.
Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This nota -
tion means the monster can use the stat block 
part once and must then finish a Short or Long 
Rest to use it again.258

the engulfed target moves with it. An engulfed target 
can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 
12 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, 
the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied 
space. Success:  Half damage, and the target moves to
