;Plot Summary
:''Seven and a half years ago''

[[Gavilar Kholin]] is in a vision with the [[Stormfather]], seeking the Words to become a [[Herald]]. The Stormfather tells him that trying random words will not work. Gavilar leaves the vision and awakes in his wife's study. The Stormfather, who is only partially aware of Gavilar's duplicitous intentions, advises Gavilar that immortality has worn on the Heralds, "weathering [their] souls and minds."

[[Dalinar Kholin]] arrives to visit Gavilar, asking what Gavilar intends with the [[Parshendi]], showing an interest in befriending them, and reflecting a degree of weariness at the war, in particular his actions in [[the Rift]]. Gavilar manipulates Dalinar to seek alcohol and instructs [[Tearim]], his guard and a [[Sons of Honor|Son of Honor]], to lead Dalinar to [[Navani]]'s wine stores.

[[Thaidakar]] appears to Gavilar via [[seon]], demanding that Gavilar deliver on his promise to deliver [[Restares]] to him. 

Restares, founder of the Sons of Honor, arrives, accompanied by a tall [[Makabaki]] man ([[Nale]]). Gavilar demonstrates that he (with the secret assistance of [[Vasher]]) has been able to harvest [[Voidlight]] from the [[Cognitive Realm]] and transfer it to the [[Physical Realm]]. Restares reveals that Thaidakar is interested in finding him because he knows how to find [[Ba-Ado-Mishram]].

Gavilar then speaks to the Stormfather, asking him why Thaidakar is interested in Ba-Ado-Mishram, to which the Stormfather answers that Ba-Ado-Mishram tried to uplift the [[Listeners]] with forms of power but ultimately failed.

A meeting of the Sons of Honor begins, including [[Taravangian]] and [[Amaram]]. Speaking with Taravangian afterward, Gavilar is pleasantly surprised to find that Taravangian is accepting of Gavilar's visions and his wider plans to restore the Voidbringers. They also discuss [[Death Rattle]]s, before [[Eshonai]] arrives.

After the meeting, Gavilar discloses to the Stormfather that, once he becomes a Herald, he will simply give in and return to [[Roshar]] with each death, rather than staying on [[Braize]] to endure torture and seal the [[Voidbringers]] away, as demanded by the [[Oathpact]]. Gavilar calls the Heralds fools for locking themselves away, and states that there was no reason to stop war between the Voidbringers and humanity, as this would be the means by which Rosharans would be trained to recover the [[Tranquiline Halls]], as dictated by [[Vorinism|Vorin theology]]. The Stormfather is horrified, and his horror is doubled when he senses the death of a Herald ([[Chanarach]]). The Stormfather severs his ties with Gavilar, just as [[Szeth]] begins his attack.

After the attack, Gavilar lays dying, and is surprised when Szeth informs him that the Parshendi ordered his death.

;Plot Summary

'''Kaladin'''

Two days after the end of the occupation of [[Urithiru]] and the awakening of the [[Sibling]], [[Kaladin]] reflects on feeling good, despite the emotional and physical exhaustion, and the death of [[Teft]] at the hands of [[Moash]] at the end of the occupation. He also reflects on the contract Dalinar entered into with [[Odium]]. Kaladin, feeling good but not great, ultimately concludes that he would someday feel great again.

He finds that his uniform, which he'd Lashed to the wall the night before, is still hanging there, showing that his powers are much stronger in the awakened Urithiru. As he finishes getting dressed, [[Syl]] enters, appearing human-sized, in a dark blue havah with purple embroidery - Kaladin reflects that she'd recently learned how to color her clothing. Kaladin asks if she can make herself any size, and she says that it takes a lot of energy, but she can make herself big enough to touch the top of Kaladin's room. She appears shorter simply because it "feels right" to her.

They discuss the coming fight, and Kaladin voices his fear that people will die when he isn't around to protect them.  Despite this, Kaladin resolves to remember that there are good days like today. Kaladin contemplates his familiarity with the wind when suddenly he hears a voice on the wind calling him by name, asking for his help, and proclaiming that the worst storm is to come. 

'''Shallan'''

[[Shallan]] walks along the very top of [[Lasting Integrity]] with [[Pattern]] and [[Testament]] overlooking the sea of glass and obsidian highlands. She speaks with Pattern about how she feels guilty about turning Testament into a [[deadeye]]. Pattern reassures her that, despite what happened to Testament, the sacrifice was worthwhile because Shallan grew from the experiences with both [[spren]]. Pattern exudes joy at not being killed by Shallan and explains to her that she still has [[Connection]] to Testament due to her childhood severing of the [[Nahel]] bond not being a full break. Shallan reflects on her recently obtained knowledge that the ancient [[Knights Radiant]] did not know how drastic the severing of their bonds would be during the [[Recreance]] and how something went wrong which resulted in deadeyes. Shallan thanks Testament and promises to help her. She then embraces Testament.

;Plot Summary

At Urithiru, Kaladin considers his feelings and identity in his family quarters. Syl, choosing to show herself partially colored, allows Kaladin's family to see her as she plays blocks with [[Oroden]]. In reference to how long Kaladin's lashings are lasting, he mentions to [[Hesina]] how [[Navani]] has done something odd to Urithiru causing the whole tower to be infused like a [[sphere]]. Hesina then tells Syl an embarrassing story about Kal. [[Lirin]] is grousing about the condition of the army medical branch. Kaladin takes a moment to appreciate the joy surrounding him in this moment with his family while Syl rests her head on his shoulder, and they discuss her choice to appear full size. The topic turns to lost comrades from [[Bridge Four]]. Kaladin asks Lirin about the trajectory of conflict before the contract takes force. The [[Wind]] clarifies the coming storm is worse than the war and encourages him to "listen to the [[Bondsmith]]." He is planning to go to [[Shinovar]] to seek out [[Ishar]], but he needs to meet with Dalinar first. Before he goes he takes a final moment to remember this peace with his family. Lirin gives Kaladin a hug and tells him to be himself and that he loves him. Kaladin reflects that he is taking the next step of his own volition. He realizes that being able to choose that next step feels great.

;Plot Summary

Shallan and Pattern walk across the wall top toward [[Kalak]], [[Adolin]], [[Maya]], and a [[seon]], and she talks to Pattern about how Veil and Shallan have become one. She admits to Pattern that Radiant is still a separate persona from her despite that no longer being the case for Veil. Pattern asks if this means Shallan remembers everything about the deaths of her [[Chanarach|mother]] and Testament. Shallan says there's still a lot to process.

Wit is speaking through the seon with Kalak and Adolin. Adolin informs Shallan that [[Order of Windrunners|Windrunners]] have been sent to bring them back to the [[Physical Realm]]. Shallan, speaking to Wit, inquires about the safety of her brothers. Wit is preparing Dalinar for the [[contest of champions]], and offers Shallan help with the [[Ghostbloods]]. Wit reveals he's ten thousand years old. Shallan discusses her concern for Formless and the capacity for evil within her. Wit responds saying she was heroic for choosing to resist. Shallan worries at her tendency to kill people who have mentored her.  

Shallan believes the Ghostbloods want Kalak for his knowledge of [[Ba-Ado-Mishram]]. She implores him to share what he knows, and he divulges that he was part of a team who captured Ba-Ado-Mishram. The [[Unmade]] was trapped in a flawless heliodor and hidden in the Spiritual Realm by [[Melishi]]. Kalak gets overwhelmed and runs off. Maya, being capable of speaking more and more, mentions she knew Kalak in the past. Mishram was close to a god and heavily Connected to Roshar, and being trapped in a gemstone directly impacts not only the forms of the [[singers]] but also the status of the deadeyes. Shallan contemplates the implications of Ghostbloods being able to manipulate the entirety of the singer army through the control of singer forms. Pattern explains that the [[Spiritual Realm]] is much stranger and much more complex than the [[Cognitive Realm]] and is a place where time and distance are warped. Maya reveals that because [[Honor]] was dead and Ba-Ado-Mishram was captured she and her Radiant chose to break their [[Nahel bond]] due to the threat Radiants posed in the destruction of Roshar. However, they did not know it would result in her deadeye status. Shallan resolves to find out how Mishram influences their bonds and to seek the location of the Unmade in the Spiritual Realm.

;Plot Summary

Kaladin flies up the atrium of Urithiru, remembering his anger at the [[Lezian|Pursuer]], and worries at the power of that rage. Arriving at the top, Syl goes to greet Navani, whose bond with the Sibling is intoxicating to spren. Kaladin finds Wit in the waiting area outside Dalinar's office reading a novel. Wit teases him about the [[trailman's flute|flute]] Kaladin lost and encourages him to learn and practice it while they wait. Kaladin agrees to, remembering how Wit helped him in the nightmare Odium tailored for him. A while later, Kaladin has some ability to produce a tune; when Syl catches up, she identifies it as the ancient tune the humans followed from [[Ashyn]] to Roshar, comprised of rhythms of the planet and tones of the gods. Kaladin recalls how the first time he heard Wit play, the tune seemed to return to accompany him, which Wit indicates was the Wind. Kaladin asks if the Wind is a god, and Wit says it is [[Old Magic]], left behind by [[Adonalsium]]. Kaladin mentions what he's been hearing from the Wind, and they end up discussing art, the [[Passions]], and hope. Kaladin worries that Wit's earnestness portends a more lasting farewell. Wit offers sincere praise to Kaladin for giving himself a second chance and tells him to go live his own story and discover who he is now after all that's happened. Dalinar finally emerges and asks if Wit is finally finished with Kaladin, as it's been an hour.

;Plot Summary

At the Lasting Integrity forum, the human contingent wait for honorspren willing to bond Windrunner squires. Shallan is able to do some sketches and finds a singer with a crown showing up in the sketches, much as the Unmade did when they first arrived at Urithiru. Twelve spren arrive, as well as [[Notum]]. Shallan does not see [[Lusintia]], who had been her sponsor at Lasting Integrity. Notum talks to Shallan about different ways he can help the effort without bonding, such as invigorating the navy or recruitment. He speaks with emotion of Adolin saving him from the [[Tukar]]i and restoring his faith in honor. Notum decides not to bond a Radiant at this time and considers trying to recruit support from other honorspren in Lasting Integrity instead. Kalak takes a seat next to Shallan and watches her draw. He is afraid to leave Lasting Integrity and is ambivalent about whether or not Ba-Ado-Mishram should be released. Shallan draws one of her aspirational pictures of him, and he asks if she often draws on [[Fortune]]. He alludes to this being a direct result of Shallan's imbricated bond with two Cryptics and describes this as glimpsing into the Spiritual Realm, and that the crowned singer appearing in her sketches is one representation of Mishram. The Windrunner [[Drehy]] and his squires arrive to fly the Kohlins to the Shadesmar side of the [[Azimir]] [[Oathgate]].

;Plot Summary

At Urithiru, Dalinar praises Kaladin's work with battle-shocked patients. He asks Kaladin to go with Szeth on the mission to Shinovar. Kaladin objects, within Szeth's earshot, that his condition is too severe for Kaladin to help. Dalinar takes Kaladin, along with Syl, to the roof of Urithiru for a private conversation. Dalinar then requests that they fly to a nearby snowy peak to better observe Urithiru's entire scope. Dalinar shares his doubts about meeting the challenges he's undertaken and expresses his concern about how much power and authority he has as an individual. Dalinar encourages Kaladin to apply his expertise in helping both Szeth and the delusional Herald Ishar. Kaladin agrees to help but mentions that he would not return in time to help Dalinar, that Ishar would not be able to help, and that he should listen to the Wind and Roshar. Even if Wit is right, Dalinar believes assessing Shinovar has merit considering how isolated and reticent from the ongoing war the nation has been. Finally, Dalinar asks Kaladin to be heir to the throne of Urithiru. Kaladin is taken aback due to his identity as a [[darkeyes]]. Dalinar persuades him to consider the request, saying that nobility is of the heart.

;Plot Summary

Shallan and her retinue prepare for departure with the Windrunners. Adolin packs his swords for the trip and will be traveling on top of a lashed [[Gallant]]. Maya describes some deadeyes being lost [[Shardblade|Blades]] whose locations in the Physical Realm are forgotten. These Blades are left to wander the bead oceans of Shadesmar indefinitely. Shallan and Adolin resolve to help the deadeyes recover like Maya has been as soon as they figure out how to replicate the process and as soon as the war is over.

Shallan talks to [[Vathah]], who is getting exceedingly better at using his [[Order of Lightweavers|Lightweaver]] abilities. Vathah, seemingly developing a fondness for [[Ishnah]], blushes when Shallan mentions her. Vathah and Shallan's remaining members of the [[Unseen Court]] will be travelling slowly by boat while Shallan's team, including Pattern, Testament, Maya, Adolin, and Gallant, are to be flown to the Azimir Oathgate. The slower team will be lead by [[Felt]], who Shallan speculates might not be from Roshar but is a capable and trusted person to leave this task to.  

Shallan speaks with Kalak about how she sees light in things that nobody else notices. Kalak informs Shallan that Light is Investiture and Investiture can take physical form. He makes it a point to Shallan that she should translate these concepts to her illusions. Shallan introspectively decides to start approaching this line of reasoning from a new perspective. Shallan embraces Kalak in a comforting way, much to the shock of the watching honorspren, and bids him farewell. 

The Windrunners and Shallan's team are lashed toward Azimir with the handy use of a compass pointing directly to the Oathgate, compliments of Urithiru's hidden storehouses. The flight is going smoothly with Adolin and Gallant seemingly having a very enjoyable time of it. Shallan finds herself admiring her wonderful, goofy husband so she takes a memory of Adolin and Gallant. The group is then attacked suddenly.

;Plot Summary

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin and Szeth prepare to travel to Shinovar by intercepting the [[highstorm]] at Azimir. [[Nightblood]], Szeth's sentient companion sword, greets him and says to pack snacks because [[Lift]] said so. Kaladin makes a stop to see [[Leyten]], the quartermaster, who has his packs, flute, Tien's toy horse, and a mysterious dull brown rock. [[Dabbid]] is seen being tailed by the honorspren [[Lusintia]], but he hasn't realized he's close to forming a bond yet. Kaladin continues to feel the Wind's presence and the looming threat of the inevitable storm. Because of this, he decides to go check in on [[Sigzil]] and the Windrunners a final time. 
 

'''Shallan'''

In Shadesmar, Shallan and Adolin are attacked by eight [[Heavenly Ones]] with only five Windrunners on their side. Adolin throws various weapons at the [[Fused]] while Shallan creates duplicate illusions to distract the Heavenly Ones. Adolin is hurled into the bead ocean after a collision with a Fused so Shallan sucks in the [[Stormlight]] from the lashing attached to her and drops toward Adolin.

'''Kaladin'''

At Urithiru, Kaladin meets with [[Skar]], who is working with new recruits, teaching them the importance of always having accountability of your spear. Skar then talks Kaladin into telling others he's leaving, which includes attending a celebration of [[Rlain]] bonding a [[Tumi|spren]]. Syl says now that Kaladin has all the things he needs, it's time to pick up her things.  

'''Shallan'''

Shallan works to rescue Adolin. She erects a building made of beads upon which Adolin, Drehy, and Shallan can stand. Drehy states that Pattern, Testament, and Maya have been deposited within the beads since they can't suffocate. Drehy exclaims that Heavenly Ones don't typically engage so furiously to kill like these ones have. Suddenly two Heavenly Ones erupt from the beads, and one of them pulls Shallan into the depths. Shallan grapples with one proclaiming himself [[Abidi]] the Monarch, a Fused who states he keeps sane by bathing in the blood of Radiants. Shallan confronts herself and admits the truth that she's afraid: afraid of the world, her family's safety, and herself. The beads around Shallan, as well as Shallan's eyes, fill with Light while a powerfully built Radiant forms behind the Fused and runs him through with what appears to be a Shardblade.

;Plot Summary

In Urithiru, Syl and Kaladin pick up a copy of ''[[The Way of Kings (in-world)|The Way of Kings]]'' for the journey in the library. The librarian is unpleasant and ill-tempered with Syl's requests. Kaladin almost complains about the weight of the book but sees how enthusiastic Syl looks about being his scribe. A runner girl's soldier outfit catches Syl's eye so she emulates the uniform with her essence, displaying her interpretation of this historical fashion piece. This woman suggests Syl add leggings, and Syl leans into the assumption of Syl's witlessness by saying under her skirts is a [[chull]] head, which she sometimes feeds grass. The runner girl awkwardly retreats and goes to grab Syl's supplies. Kaladin asks for clarification, and Syl says that as a creature influenced by perception, she has what people tend to have. The scribe returns with pen, ink, and paper while the librarian proceeds to belittle Syl for barely being able to write a single character. At this point, Kaladin tells the woman to stop belittling Syl, who is trying to improve herself, and that the librarian should go seek help and someone to talk to if something is causing her to treat others so poorly. The librarian nods, drawing a single [[shamespren]] and leaving Kaladin and Syl free to continue on their way.

;Plot Summary

After grappling with Abidi, Shallan rescues Adolin by shaping the beads into the shape of a room, the bead of which was questionably and conveniently obtained, at the bottom of the glass sea. Upon reaching Adolin, she begins experiencing strange voices and disorientation. She wonders if she's manifesting Adolin and eventually trusts that he's real. Suddenly, the beads on a wall of Shallan's created room manifest the shape of Ba-Ado-Mishram, who vows to exact vengeance on all humans. Adolin disrupts the face of beads with his greatsword. Because Adolin's attack collapsed the previous room, Shallan manifests a new spherical shaped room with another very specific and conveniently obtained bead. They rise to the surface of the bead ocean to seek out their team of Windrunners.

Resurfacing from the glass beads with Adolin, Shallan sees Drehy's squire crash into the beads so she forms a large ring of beads for the woman to stand on while Shallan raises her to the surface. Abidi lands on Shallan's platform and attempts to dispel the fallen Windrunner but Adolin intercedes and impales Abidi with his greatsword, causing the Fused to take flight in retreat. However, the Fused's [[Voidlight]] runs out almost immediately, causing Abidi to fall into the sea of beads. The other Fused see this and fly to Abidi's aid, but Shallan forms Radiant again and fires a [[Shardbow]] at the Heavenly Ones, causing them to scatter. Drehy and his team all regroup on the platform, and Shallan forms a room of beads which takes them to the bottom of the bead ocean. Since the Fused saw where they entered the ocean of beads, Drehy compels Shallan to keep them moving, and Shallan guides them to recover their spren companions. Drehy has a compass device that points toward something called the [[Grand Knell]], which is the source of a current and is related to the death of a god according to the [[Sibling]].

After creating some distance from the Heavenly Ones, Adolin asks Drehy to scout ahead, so Shallan brings the room of beads to the surface of the ocean and opens a hatch in the ceiling. Drehy locates a small island where Gallant is interacting with a herd of [[musicspren]] who are running and galloping through the air. One of the musicspren seems familiar to Adolin and lingers for Adolin to pet its muzzle. Adolin vocalizes this familiarity in shock. After recovering Gallant, the group investigates lights in the distance. Under the guise of a musicspren herd made from Shallan's Lightweaving, the group approaches hundreds of ships including thousands of singer troops from the [[Horneater Peaks]] headed directly for Azimir. Adolin tells Drehy to get their group to Azimir as fast as possible.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan and company reach the Oathgate that corresponds to Azimir. The spren of the Oathgate, two enormous [[inkspren]], announce they are now free through [[Sja-anat]]'s influence and will transport whomever they wish, including not only Shallan and her retinue, but also the singer army. They agree to transfer the Kholins and their companions, only for now. Just before the transfer, Shallan notices a number of beads from the sea have clung to her, giving her an impression in her mind of chanting her name over and over. Pattern informs Shallan that these are [[creationspren]].  

As they emerge in the Physical Realm, these transform into red-colored [[Shardplate]], meaning she has achieved the Fourth Ideal while in Shadesmar. Shallan internalizes some tailored adjustments to her newly formed Shardplate armor, of which her creationspren are very eager and willing to accommodate all while continuing to chant her name to her. Adolin is ecstatic about Shallan's Plate and cautions her with its use. Radiant considers that short hair would be more practical but Shallan is mortified at the idea.

In the middle of a highstorm, and drawing close to midnight, Shallan and Adolin meet up with Kaladin. Shallan immediately hugs him and a full-sized Syl. Adolin tells Kaladin of the approaching army, and Kaladin explains that the Windrunners in Urithiru will be able to help and that he is needed in Shinovar along with Szeth per Dalinar's instruction. Shallan is surprised by Kaladin's optimism in his conviction. Kaladin says Honor is dead, but Adolin says Honor lives within each of them. They ask him to meet up after they talk to Dalinar, but he says he should have left already. He uncharacteristically hugs them, and Adolin asks that the four of them (indicating Syl) should meet up for drinks after all this is over. Kaladin is hestitant at first, not being able to predict the future, but Shallan says this isn't goodbye and makes Kaladin promise.
  
When Shallan summons a Blade for the Oathgate, Testament appears instead of Pattern. They transfer to Urithiru, experiencing the awakened tower for the first time. Adolin goes to prepare for a war council, and Shallan plans to gather the Urithiru Lightweavers to make a plan to deal with the Ghostbloods.  

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin watches Shallan and Adolin walk away and is surprised he feels relief that they're together and not him with Shallan. The ways they were both neurotic would have been problematic, and she needs Adolin. Kaladin marvels at his ability to appreciate his close friendship with both of them and wonders if this is how emotions should normally work when he isn't experiencing depression. Syl asks what Kal needs, and Kal wonders if that is part of what they'll find out on this trip. He remembers Dalinar's offer and considers that it would make him brothers with Adolin and Renarin. As he takes in the Light of the storm, he resolves to survive what's coming no matter what. He and Szeth set out towards Shinovar at the front of the stormwall.

[[Cultivation]] speaks to him about godhood, attempting to teach him her way of slowly nudging toward better outcomes over time, but he rages against her and the other gods of the [[cosmere]]. He blames them for being complicit and not doing better with all the time they've had. Odium concludes that there will be no release from his agony until there is but one god. He bids Cultivation leave him, and she does, allowing him to contemplate his nature. He resolves to control the [[Shard]] of Odium as [[Taravangian]], not the other way around, and reaffirms his commitment to save all.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar is awake late at night on his balcony at Urithiru. He contemplates if Gavilar would have done better in his current position. He feels a tension in the air and realizes that the storm has arrived when a panicked Windrunner knocks at his quarters.

'''Jasnah'''

[[Jasnah]] is wide awake late at night in her chambers in Urithiru. [[Wit]] is sleeping a bed too soft for Jasnah's liking, so she sulks about the discomfort before contemplating the lack of trust from Wit based on the lies he tells her. She realizes that she's been worrying about her relationship with Wit in the wake of the approaching contest of champions in eight days. Her thoughts move to Dalinar being the one to face Odium's champion despite all of her training and preparation. She recounts a trend of support, over the years, to Dalinar when he shares difficult truths but realizes that she receives nothing short of condemnation when she shares similar hard truths with the world. She also remembers a time she was locked away, a time nobody else seems to remember, when Wit suddenly wakes in a frenzy. He pulls out a notebook and begins to write in a language unfamiliar to Jasnah. Wit pulls out some [[sand]] as he begins to draft a table in that same unfamiliar language. Wit's frustration is subconsciously affecting his [[Allomancy|Mistborn]] abilities, which is causing all the metal in the room to move from his Allomantic pushes. Upon use of his kinetic [[Investiture]], the sand turns vibrantly white. Wit's subconscious anxiety further translates to his use of [[Awakening]] in his nightclothes. He briefly becomes a subtly shorter person with stark white hair during his panicked state. Jasnah sees this before Wit reverts to his normal physical appearance and calms down a little. He realizes that his [[Breath]]s have been altered and he is missing three minutes and twenty-seven seconds from his memory after an encounter with Odium a few days prior. Jasnah realizes that he didn't confide this encounter with her and decides that there would never be a depth to their relationship. Wit sees now that Odium let Wit get the better of them both in their conversation on purpose, which is very unlike [[Rayse]]'s character. Wit states that he can no longer predict what Rayse will do, not knowing that Odium has a new Vessel in [[Taravangian]]. Wit begins reviewing the contract immediately when a knock at Jasnah's chambers informs her of the [[singer]] invasion via the Oathgate in Azimir. A meeting of monarchs will occur at first bell, and Jasnah promises to be there. 

'''Navani'''

Navani, unable to sleep, is traversing through a tunnel in Urithiru. The tunnel opens to a chamber full of various [[fabrial]]s on the wall that divert water throughout the tower, provide heat to the tower, and provide air ventilation. She feels a deep connection to the Sibling, Urithiru, and the spren that are drawn to her. She finds the experience overwhelming but welcomes each facet of what she's feeling in her bond with the Sibling. She learns that she no longer needs to sleep due to their bond but must not leave the tower for a long period of time to avoid weakening her bond with the Sibling. The Sibling informs Navani of a Windrunner at Dalinar's door and that something urgent has come up.

'''Queen Fen'''

[[Queen Fen]] and her husband [[Kmakl]] are wide awake cuddling in a hammock on the royal yacht, enjoying a short respite from daily queenly responsibilities. They're interrupted by a lieutenant searching for them with a lantern full of diamond spheres which he immediately drops and shatters upon seeing the private state of Fen and Kmakl. After Queen Fen gives the lieutenant a hard time, he regains some composure and informs Fen of the singer army invasion in Azimir via Shadesmar. A moment later admiral [[Fladrn]] enters the quarters and informs the group of an enemy [[Skybreaker]] breach in the [[Jah Keved]] blockade. With the blockade broken, an enemy assault force is headed directly for [[Thaylen City]]. 

'''Yanagawn'''

[[Yanagawn]] thinks about how he is asleep per his strict schedule, and blessed citizens are there observing him sleep per [[Azish]] tradition. Yanagawn's thoughts drift to him being a symbol to be paraded around, to him wishing he were dangerous and able to act outside the confines of routine, and to the presence of Shards in Azir. He feels he could be doing more than just sleep when guards arrive, breaking protocol and portending something significant happening.

;Plot Summary

'''Adolin'''

After only a few short hours of sleep, Adolin takes a comforting shower, for the very first time, in his chambers in Urithiru. A soft glow of light behind the stone of the shower wall allow adjustments for heat and pressure. Shallan is also impressed with the novelty of a shower and joins her husband. They share a warm embrace and loving words before continuing on to discuss deeper topics. Shallan mentions her need to deal with the Ghostbloods while Adolin is realizing he's still upset with his father after learning about his mother [[Evi]]'s fate a year prior. Adolin agrees to tell Dalinar of Shallan's dealings with the Ghostbloods and to represent them in the upcoming meeting. Before they each set out to their respective tasks, they share a tasteful and intimate moment making love in the shower, producing [[passionspren]] as a result. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar purposefully moves through mostly empty hallways to the atrium, noticing the impacts of the recent invasion which have caused people to stay in their rooms. Sigzil meets up with Dalinar and reports that not only are the singers assaulting Azimir and Thaylen City, but they're also striking against the [[Shattered Plains]]. Dalinar had assumed the days leading up to the contest of champions would predominantly include border domination instead of foundational cities in the heart of the [[coalition of monarchs|coalition]]. Dalinar posts extra guards around Urithiru's most vulnerable areas before seeing a troubled [[Gavinor]] in tears. Dalinar briefly reassures the youth before being drawn away by a different familiar figure bearing a strong physical resemblance to [[Cultivation]].

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan emerges from the shower and meets with some of her closest members of the [[Unseen Court]], [[Gaz]], [[Red (Roshar)|Red]], [[Stargyle]], and [[Darcira]]. Her team was disguised nearby via Lightweaving keeping watch, and they reveal to Shallan that they did not see anyone from the Ghostbloods spying on Shallan and Adolin's chambers. They review sketches from Wit which provide identities of twelve members of the Ghostbloods and Shallan still believes she holds the secret of Ba-Ado-Mishram's location, which will cause them to come after her and her family, including her Unseen Court members. Shallan wants to form a strike team to counter, but first tests applying her Shardplate to Red at his request. The creationspren are eager as always but only seem to be able to provide Shardplate to others in a non-mobile capacity since Red can't move in the Plate. They move on, and Shallan confides in her team that she wants to steal secrets the Ghostbloods want. Before they can do that they will first locate the Ghostbloods' base. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar confronts Cultivation in a hallway adjacent to the atrium. She implores Dalinar to find his own answers and tells him he needs to seek the history of the world to understand where the Shard Honor is, despite Odium having killed the previous Vessel. Cultivation tells Dalinar to find truths about Heralds, Radiants, and Honor in the past by entering the Spiritual Realm, as this is where visions from the Stormfather have manifested from. She also says that Honor's shard is seeking a new Vessel and that Dalinar needs to continue on his current path while seeking the past. 

Cultivation leaves, and Dalinar discusses all of this with the Stormfather. Dalinar wants more insight into visions, through the Spiritual Realm, into how Honor was killed, how Heralds were decided, and how humans migrated to Roshar. The Stormfather is reluctant, since he considers this dangerous. 

Dalinar makes it to the meeting room and Jasnah informs him of Wit's encounter with Odium and how loopholes may be exploited after all in the contract. Dalinar absorbs this information then starts facilitating troop counts to distribute to the nations under attack.

;Plot Summary

'''Adolin'''

Adolin approaches the lifts in Urithiru's atrium to attend the strategy meeting and brings Dalinar's bodyguard, [[Colot]], whom Dalinar accidentally left behind. On the lift, Adolin has a short conversation with Yanagawn, in the presence of Yanagawn's ever-present entourage, about decision making and the burden of his role as well as Yanagawn's past as a poor thief. Adolin notices an increasingly growing maturity from the young emperor. 

'''Shallan'''

Shallan is wearing a Lightweaving guise of a [[crem]] scraper in a hallway near the atrium, keeping an eye on Adolin as he ascends the lift to ensure his safety. She also sends [[Isom]] and Stargyle to check on Adolin and attend the meeting respectively. Shallan is in close company with a Lightweaving-disguised Gaz, who is posing as a [[rockbud]] flower merchant. They have not seen sight of any of the Ghostbloods from Wit's drawings. Shallan compliments Gaz on fully committing to his Lightweaving disguise and says he's getting better at it. They discuss Gaz's gambling addiction and Gaz's revelation that keeping busy helping Shallan is what's helping him stay away from gambling instead of setting a budget on his gambling spending. That and the gambling dens more or less banning Gaz thanks to Red and Stargyle interfering on Gaz’s behalf. Suddenly, Gaz's [[spanreed]] starts blinking signaling that [[Shob]] identified one of the Ghostbloods. They move out to Shob's location.

;Plot Summary

'''Adolin'''

Adolin arrived to the meeting and brings his own chair into the room per normal protocol during a Urithiru meeting of Rosharan leaders. Queen Fen frets over Dalinar's lack of proper terms in the contract with Odium and expresses concern over the next eight days of extreme war before the contest of champions. Adolin, letting his anger at his father fester, thinks that Dalinar deserves the animosity directed at him. Yanagawn reassures the group that Dalinar did his best and that they all previously agreed to let him take individual charge of this responsibility, to which Queen Fen agrees. She says she is just frustrated that her city is being attacked again after barely recovering the past year. Just when the group was moving on to a map projection, courtesy of Dalinar and Stargyle, Wit interrupts, exclaiming that he's been an idiot for missing major loopholes in the contract set with Odium.

Wit realizes that the borders would never be fought over in these last days leading to the contest of champions since they'd be lost if Dalinar won anyway. Wit informs the group that if Odium's forces captures capital cities, then the entire kingdoms are considered captured. That's why singer troops are directed at Azimir, Thaylen City, and the Shattered Plains in a final gambit to secure more land for Odium's side before the deadline. Wit further reveals that he reached out to [[Frost]] for help in this matter, but Frost refused, leaving his sister to help instead. She reviewed the contract and Alethi legal codes, discovering the loophole. Wit proclaims that Rayse could never have taken advantage of a loophole like this after vowing not to since it's in his nature and since a promise of Odium was made to Dalinar on this specific point. Wit realizes that Rayse is dead and that the Shard of Odium has been taken up by a new Vessel, a genius who is taking advantage of clever facets to conquer as much ground as possible before the deadline. 

'''Shallan'''

Shallan, Gaz, and Shob are posing as Herdazian workers in a hallway adjacent to the atrium looking at sketches of Ghostbloods. Darcira is tailing the spotted Ghostblood, who is a former actor and a new recruit, according to Hoid's notes. Shob is complaining about his nose, his head, and his heart bothering him as a guard passes by. Gaz quickly Lightweaves the Ghostblood drawing he's holding into a naked woman so the guard sees a few Herdazians having some harmless fun and moves on. Darcira reports, via spanreed blinking, that she tracked the Ghostblood hideout to [[Narak]]. Shallan says they're going to hit the hideout with a strike team only after infiltrating and learning what the Ghostbloods are planning and if [[Mraize]] and [[Iyatil]] are going to be inside when they do strike. Shallan checks on Shob in earnest and says they'll get him proper help for his very real-feeling ailments once this is all done. Shob is genuinely appreciative that Shallan cares and is listening to his concerns of pain and discomfort. She then sends Shob up to the meeting to gather information with Stargyle.

Szeth and Kaladin approach Shinovar, airborn, through a pass in the [[Misted Mountains]]. Szeth contemplates his routines involving a shaved head and white clothing and is put off by the idea of having granular preferences to such things. As they make it through the mountain pass, the presence of green, lush vegetation increases rapidly until plants that do not pull back at physical touch are abundant everywhere. Kaladin finds this extremely odd and Szeth finds beauty and comfort in the plants. Szeth's highspren, whose name is still unknown to Szeth, tells Szeth not to be emotional since he should be serving the law. Kaladin tests the reflexes of a plant by almost crushing it, and Szeth sees this behavior as cowardly without fully understanding all the idiosyncratic behaviors that make the application of that word untrue when applied to Kaladin. He is grateful to walk on the soil of Shinovar again instead of blasphemous stone, and he explains to Kaladin that the plants here are not like ones Kaladin is used to but that they are very much the norm here.

;Plot Summary

Navani is awestruck at the implications of a new Odium. Wit is still explaining to the coalition that Rayse being dead is the most likely situation affecting the recent contract exploits from Odium. Navani hears the Sibling and [[Stormfather]] in her head discussing a slight change in the tone of Odium, and both of them confirm that the Shard of Odium has taken on a new Vessel. The Stormfather angrily expresses his regret at not being the one to kill Rayse. Wit states that because the new Odium was likely a mortal until their recent [[Ascension]], they are likely to be more bold and unpredictable in the use of their power. Exploiting the loophole in claiming capitals for entire nation acquisition, per Alethi law, is also not a violation of a promise since it was Rayse who made the original verbal promise, not actually written in the contract, and not the new Vessel who made the promise. Wit also says that when a deity breaks a certain aspect of a contract, the significance of the contract point being broken and the severity of the consequences are directly correlated. This is why the new Odium won't break any points of the written contract, only loopholes made via verbal promises from Rayse.

This news creates panic within the coalition, and Wit explains that if they broke the contract and called off the contest of champions, then Odium would be able to capitalize on the situation and directly intervene, killing any number of people on Roshar on command. Navani suggests changing the locations of capitals in an attempt to exploit their own loophole but Wit says, while the idea itself is clever, that this idea and a dozen others he's thought of are in direct violation of the written contract. 

Navani and Dalinar acquiesce to being back at square one and they put the efforts of the group's attention to defending Azimir, Thaylen City, and the Shattered Plains. Dalinar and Stargyle make a map of Roshar together, similar to how Dalinar and Shallan have done in the past. The Sibling is very impressed with the map as the coalition discusses troop numbers and allocation.

The singer force moving against Azimir has around 15,000 troops with few Fused, while the force sailing to Thaylen City has 40,000 enemies, including Skybreakers and a fair number of Fused, and the force moving toward the Shattered Plains is only a thousand singers but almost entirely Fused.

Most of the available Radiants and human troops are too far from these cities or Oathgates to help in time. Azimir has a strong position and troops only a handful of days away but if Azimir falls then, not only will Azir fall, the rest of the tenuously aligned empire will go with it including [[Emul]], [[Yezier]], and [[Desh]]. Thaylen City lost most of their ground support during the [[Battle of Thaylen Field]] over a year back, and the Shattered Plains are well-defended but only by regular non-Radiant troops. The coalition's forces are spread too thin across too great of distances to defend all three locations. 

Navani feels like she's missing something as Dalinar and the [[Mink]] share a glance, reaching the same conclusion that Jasnah voices at the same time: trying to save all three cities will result in a loss of all three. Immediately-available troops will be split only between Thaylen City and the Shattered Plains, while Azimir must wait five days for 40,000 troops to arrive and will only be sent a few thousand immediate troops to hold. 

After a concern for defending Urithiru is brought up, the Sibling creates a column of light in the center of the room from two glass discs and tells everyone that Urithiru is robustly protected from singers due to the nature of the awakening of the Tower and the presence of [[Towerlight]] along with its associated rhythms. Because of this, the Mink declares that the 20,000 troops in Urithiru can be deployed immediately.

It is decided that Adolin and two thousand troops will head the defense of Azimir while awaiting the 40,000 reinforcements; Jasnah and 20,000 troops will go to the defense of Thaylen City; and Sigzil, [[Dami]], and most of the Windrunners to the defense of the Shattered Plains.

The group breaks into action. Adolin lingers and he and Dalinar have a tense exchange where Adolin describes Shallan's dealings with the Ghostbloods and the need of a Radiant strike force. After some heated words are exchanged, Dalinar grants authorization for the force. Dalinar feels like he isn't able to reach his son, and Adolin feels anger toward his father for his shortcomings. Dalinar also gives Adolin a few-weeks-long Bondsmithing to communicate with the Azish while he's in Azimir. 

Adolin leaves, and Navani tells Dalinar to do more to make reparations with Adolin, but Dalinar isn't sure how to fix things between them. Then he says there's no time at the moment and that he needs to tell Navani, Jasnah, and Wit about his encounter with Cultivation in Urithiru.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan and a strike team of four others, under the Lightweaving guise of common soldiers, catch the Oathgate to the Shattered Plains with a group of soldiers. They pass into the Narak Four barracks, emerging out the other side as crem scrapers, joined by another strike team Lightweaver. The entire team includes Shallan, Gaz, Red, Darcira, [[Jeneh]], and [[Jayn]]. After catching one of Yanagawn's lesser [[vizier]]s enter the Ghostbloods building, Shallan's strike team keeps watch of the Ghostbloods hideout and sees a masked individual from the sketches doing a thorough inspection of members entering the building, including a black sand inspection to detect kinetic Investiture. Shallan and her team check each other's readiness and commitment to the mission before finalizing their resolve. They plan to infiltrate the Ghostbloods to learn some of their knowledge but they do plan to integrate some Windrunners to the actual fighting and capture of Ghostbloods after learning what they can. Shallan considers the desires of the Ghostbloods: taking Stormlight offworld through Shadesmar and locating Ba-Ado-Mishram. She and her force begin the next phase of their plan which involves no use of her surges or her spren due to the black sand. 

'''Sigzil'''

Sigzil is experiencing impostor syndrome in his role as leader of the Windrunners and exhibits some doubt while among the important leaders of the coalition meeting. He is reassured by his spren [[Vienta]] before noticing Dalinar, Navani, Jasnah, and Fen all entering a side room for a private discussion. He turns his attention to Kmakl and [[Ka]], who are discussing the number of Fused and the allocation of Windrunners to combat the singer numbers. They lean into the idea of keeping a dynamic allocation of Windrunners to the Shattered Plains and Thaylen City between Oathgates as needs fluctuate during battle. They discuss the idea of assigning people to keep speaking with Oathgate spren so that the functionality of the Oathgates between cities is not adversely affected by their inaction. At this moment, Sigzil stops doubting himself, thinking of his spren's encouragement, and he mentions that he has an idea. They intend to speak with the Mink about their ideas and questions but can't locate him in the room.

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah, entering the private meeting room with Dalinar, Navani, and Fen, notices that the room is full of plants, with light embedded in the stone walls and lifespren now that the tower is awake. The room is said to be for the [[Nightwatcher]] if she ever decides to visit Urithiru. Jasnah inquires to the age of the Nightwatcher which leads to the Sibling saying the Nightwatcher is from the [[Night]] and the Stormfather is from the Wind back when the wind was very different. The Sibling tells Jasnah they were created six thousand years ago from [[Stone]] when Bondsmiths used to bond to ancient forces instead of spren. Jasnah tells the Sibling that the Stormfather is seven thousand years old and the Sibling explains that Night, Wind, and Stone were all siblings and the Nightwatcher, Stormfather, and Sibling are siblings but not like they remember after being asleep for so long.

Dalinar expresses that he is not ready for the contest of champions while Jasnah glances into Shadesmar and spots Lift and the Mink. Wit returns to the group with snacks, and the rest gather around, eat, and discuss Dalinar's vulnerabilities to Odium and the contract. Wit carries the conversation to say that the Shard of Odium has volition and describes how even fragments of Shards have [[Identity]] and [[Intent]]. Dalinar says that Cultivation told him to seek out the past and the Spiritual Realm through visions in order to know how to defeat Odium. 

Wit gives a brief description of [[Realmatic Theory]] before warning the group of the dangers of traversing the unbound Spiritual Realm. Dalinar asks Wit if he knows what happened to Honor and if he knows where the location of the Shard of Honor is. The implication being Cultivation nudging Dalinar to potentially be the new Vessel of Honor if the Shard was located. Jasnah, feeling uneasy about this line of thought, counters saying maybe it doesn't have to be the only option and instead suggests they could renegotiate the contract with the new Odium. Dalinar thinks that a renegotiation would only benefit Odium and that other options need to be explored. Wit suspects that the Spiritual Realm is where Dalinar needs to start searching, locate some lingering remnant of what Honor used to be, then convince the Shard to take him as a new Vessel.

It's revealed that Lift and the [[Mink]] are hiding under a table and eavesdropping. The Mink points out that if they reclaimed Alethkar before the deadline, then they would keep it regardless of the contest of champions outcome but it's determined to be impossible based on troop and distance logistics. So the Mink calls in the promised aid for [[Herdaz]] instead. Even with the dire need of the Mink's strategic mind and Windrunner troops to protect the cities they do hold, Dalinar keeps his oath and relinquishes fifty Windrunners for the Mink to take his 200-strong personal army to reclaim Herdaz before the eight remaining days are up. The Mink leaves to take action and Lift tells Dalinar that becoming a god is deevy while she finishes all the food Wit brought. The Stormfather makes his presence known and exhibits a dislike for the conversation and the implications of it.

;Plot Summary

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin and Syl are marveling at the lush plants of Shinovar, Kaladin feeling like he's frozen in time among the nonresponsive plants and Syl weaving between trees like a ribbon of light as she laughed. Kaladin tries to broach the topic of Szeth's mental well being by saying that his mental wounds can be healed and made easier to bear. However, Szeth says that this is unnecessary because he is deserving of all the trauma he has after all the killing and trauma he has caused. Szeth shuts the conversation down and says he is here only for his quest and that Kaladin should focus on his quest of finding Ishar. Szeth explains that he needs to cleanse Shinovar of an Unmade whose presence has been known since before Kaladin swore his first oaths. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar meets with the Stormfather alone, all the while contemplating the give and take of their relationship. The Stormfather's constant presence can be cumbersome to an extent and is not like other Radiant bonds with their spren. Strife exists between them both from the time when Dalinar used the Stormfather to operate an Oathgate or when the Stormfather refused to act to save Kaladin in free fall at Urithiru. The Stormfather pulls Dalinar into a face-to-face vision displaying the Stormfather in all his vastness including infinite clouds and lighting in his inhuman eyes. The Stormfather is very upset with Dalinar for considering taking up the Shard of Honor and is frustrated that Dalinar's behavior is worse than Gavilar's on this particular point. Dalinar is frustrated at never having complete answers about Honor or what he's supposed to do to contest Odium and he feels abandoned by Honor. Reluctantly, the Stormfather admits that what happened to Honor is worse than previously mentioned and that Dalinar should seek the Spiritual Realm but only to learn from the past, not to seek the Shard of Honor. He says that Dalinar will be taken out of the Stormfather's control if he enters the Spiritual Realm and will finally see a shame that the Stormfather bears. 

Dalinar is returned to normal consciousness. Wit, having overheard the conversation, says he cares about the people on Roshar but not as much as keeping Odium in the Rosharan system. Wit says that if Dalinar is going into the Spiritual Realm, then he needs a way to track time since months, years, or decades can pass quickly and he needs to send his mind only, but not his body. Wit pulls out a clock from [[Silverlight Mercantile]] and has Dalinar form a Connection from this clock to the one Dalinar wears from Navani. This binds the time and date to the Physical Realm on Roshar instead of risking a new perception of time in the Spiritual Realm. In order for Dalinar to venture into the Spiritual Realm he must now open a [[Perpendicularity]] and push through only with his mind lest he end up in the Cognitive Realm. Dalinar will attempt this with Jasnah and Navani present to watch.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan and her strike team set up a small pavilion in the rain next to the Ghostblood headquarters while the rain picked up in earnest. The masked guard woman by the entrance sent out a man named [[Shade (character)|Shade]] to check on the operation. None of Shallan's Lightweaver strike team used any [[Illumination]] to disguise themselves in case they got too near to the black sand and instead drew cloaks over their heads to hide their identities. Shade told them to move with the pedigree of a sergeant so Shallan's crew of fake crem scrapers start breaking down their work area. They need the masked guard's mask so were hoping to speak with her instead of Shade. Shade returns to the Ghostbloods building and enters when [[Gaz]] rejoins the group and, pretending to be the cream scraper supervisor, acts angry for them disassembling the work area without authorization from him. So Shallan goes up to the masked woman in a farce to explain what's going on in regards to her foreman's complaints. The woman, not falling for Shallan's ruse, is combat ready and quickly moves to seize Shallan but not before Shallan commands her [[creationspren]] to encase the woman's body entirely. She can no longer move or speak so Gaz and Red toss her into their cart and cover her with a tarp. Shallan puts on the clothing and mask after Gaz strangles the woman unconscious. Shallan emulates the woman's posture and takes up the guard post at the entry of the building alone. A few minutes later two Ghostbloods of Queen Fen's personnel arrive, [[Aika]] and [[Jezinor]]. Shallan enters with the group after performing a thorough pat down and black sand check of the last two members.

'''Navani'''

Navani is knee-deep in dealing with a plethora of logistical and administrative issues regarding Urithiru including living quarters, meals, trade, and other resources. She speaks with [[Turinad Sebarial|Sebarial]] and [[Palona]] about soulcasting resources stretched thin and they comment on the need of more gemhearts and stress the importance of not losing the Shattered Plains. Navani and [[Aladar]] discuss what it means to be [[lighteyed]] now that so many darkeyed Radiants have sworn oaths and become lighteyed. Various spren swarm around her constantly as she mulls this over and solves a dozen other problems in crisis mode. Navani thinks about the implications of Dalinar ascending the Shard of Honor and the Sibling tells her of the dangers that could come if a Shard is without a Vessel for too long. Navani then moves into a side room where Rushu and some male ardents have set up some fabrials with an oven for a demonstration. Rushu takes a flamespren from the oven and swaps it for the one in a ruby heating fabrial. They control it with Stormlight diffusion, aluminum, and tuning fork techniques. There appears to be no adverse impact to the flamespren that was in the fabrial, based on its behavior in the oven, but the Sibling disapproves anyway. Rushu goes on to explain that you can keep, cultivate, and domesticate flamespren in the ovens over time based on your perception of them by giving them treats such as compliments and names. This should allow the spren to be trained to willingly enter fabrials in shifts and be trained and treated well over time instead of trapping them unwillingly. The Sibling slowly comes around to this idea and says it’s a good step forward. To Rushu's delight, the Sibling begins speaking with her and tells Navani that Dalinar is finished speaking with the Stormfather so Navani goes to her husband.

:''Twenty-six years ago''

Szeth dances vigorously around his family's boulder according to a strict routine and then slowly lets himself be taken by more fluid motions with the wind as his sister plays her flute in accompaniment. [[Elid]], Szeth's sister, berates him for working himself to hard as a sweaty Szeth goes to get water from a trough. Szeth's father, [[Neturo]] was patching the roof of their homestead nearby during a respite from his normal work as a sheep shepherd trainer. Szeth reattaches his colorful red piece of clothing, called his splash, and considers how his sister has become apathetic while he is earnest in his dancing conviction. He and his sister discuss the lands beyond Shinovar where people walk on stone and kill one another. Szeth thinks [[Clearmount]] is the perfect place to live with all the grazing opportunity around, proximity to the ocean, near the [[Stoneward monastery]], and far removed from other inhabited areas. Szeth hugs Molli the sheep and takes comfort in knowing that his family is meant to add instead of subtract from the world. Szeth and Elid speak of the raids from the ocean and how the job of the sword holding Honorbearers is to fight the Voidbringers, not the people raiding their homestead. This is when Molli unearths an exposed rock after licking off some soil. Szeth knows that this isn't one of the stones accounted for in the area and, in a panic, tries to remember if he stepped on this revered stone while dancing before running off to fetch their father for help.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan enters the Ghostbloods' hideout disguised as the masked woman her strike team incapacitated. They proceed into a basement within the building. Shallan takes on the gait and movements of what she would expect a masked member of the Ghostbloods to be and watches the room full of Ghostblood members which includes Mraize and Iyatil. Mraize is making a show of playing with a [[Thaylen]] hand ballista, and firing bolts at targets across the room, while chatting with other members about the limitations in only thinking of specific situations in the past. Shallan considers his words and realizes that the gemstone on the hand ballista has implications of killing Radiants or Fused with properly infused [[anti-Light]]. Iyatil looks at Shallan a few times which causes Shallan to feel nervous enough to draw an [[anxietyspren]] before she rebuffs her mental fortitude and continues her ruse. After a nod from Iyatil, Mraize explains to the group that he and Iyatil will follow Dalinar into the Spiritual Realm to track down Ba-Ado-Mishram and that [[Zora]] will be left in charge of the remaining Ghostbloods and that she will report to Thaidakar. Shallan covertly signals her team to get ready with her spanreed before Iyatil slinks over to her and whispers something in a language she doesn't know. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar and Navani discuss the prospects of Dalinar's Ascension to the Shard of Honor and what that would mean to Dalinar's relationship with her. Wit conveys to Dalinar the dangers and massive effort required in Dalinar's voyage into the Spiritual Realm along with the importance of seeking the truth through visions that the Stormfather has not shown him previously. Dalinar learns from Wit that Ascending would give him a near-infinite capacity to understand possibilities and Dalinar himself feels that he's the sole person this burden should be placed upon but that he could transfer the Shard to another if it were to change him too much. Wit explains that giving up the power of a Shard is extremely difficult and vaguely references it happening once before. After this, Navani and Dalinar both agree that she should accompany Dalinar into the Spiritual Realm to help interpret what he sees. Wit tells them to try just sending their consciousness into the Spiritual Realm first with their bodies left behind so that he can pull them back if need be. Wit tells the Bondsmiths that using a Connection to the Spiritual Realm to something Wit experienced in the past will allow them to corroborate events to verify validity then try something Wit hasn't experienced after that. They move to begin a Spiritual Realm entry at a lower physical elevation, in the event they accidentally send themselves through a Perpendicularity into the Cognitive Realm, so they don't risk the danger of falling a great distance.

Shallan, disguised as [[Aleen]], can't reply to Iyatil so she tries nodding to her. This prompts Iyatil and Shallan to move toward the other masked individual in the room, [[Lieke]], where they speak in that same foreign language. Shallan decides to pretend she's distracted by a sighting of Sja-anat in the reflection of the room's metallic doorknob to which Iyatil hisses and leaves toward Mraize. Lieke moves off toward Iyatil and Shallan has a private conversation with Sja-anat who is amused with Shallan's, so far, successful deception. Sja-anat expresses her discontent and frustration with the three existing Rosharan Shards and states that survival and preservation of the world for her children is her ultimate goal.  Iyatil brings Mraize back, tells Lieke to stay with the others, then brings him and Shallan into the previous chamber full of Iyatil's trophies. They speak with Sja-anat about an update on Dalinar's progress into the Spiritual Realm so that they may enter when he does. This is when it is revealed that Mraize and Iyatil have both bonded corrupted spren from Sja-anat and will use them for guidance in the Spiritual Realm. Sja-anat tells them that Shallan is hunting them and Shallan notices an anti-Stormlight crossbow bolt in Mraize's quiver. Mraize moves back into the chamber full of Ghostbloods and Iyatil tells Shallan that Mraize's goals may not align with the greater purpose. She also tells Shallan that the search for Ba-Ado-Mishram serves her purposes not Thaidakar's and that Thaidakar wants to protect [[Scadrial]] more than anything else. At this point Iyatil realizes something is off about Shallan posing as Aleen and she knocks Shallan's hood aside and screams that the Radiants have found their hideout.

After discovering the new stone, Szeth's father inspects it while a parrot brings word of this to Szeth's mom [[Zeenid]]. Szeth asks his father what they should do about the new stone. Neturo explains that the [[Stone Shamans]] may require them to move if they bring this discovery to them and Elid protests the idea while Szeth says that's the right decision so long that it is right. Zeenid arrives with a shovel and proposes moving the rock, to Szeth's horror. Since Szeth discovered the rock, Neturo postulates a choice to Szeth that they move the rock or they move where they live. Szeth wanting to pick what's right, ends up picking the option of moving the rock, sensing that's what the rest of his family wanted all along. Zeenid digs up the rock to move it and Szeth's father and mother rationalize that this decision is perfectly fine due to their interpretation of their devotion to the Stone Shamans' teachings. A horn sounds announcing Stonewalkers invading the southern coast so Zeenid picks up the rock with gloves and deposits it by a tree near their home. Relieved at not being struck down for moving the stone, the family moves to secure the sheep while Zeenid returns the shovel.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan activates her spanreed, summons her creationspren Shardplate, summons Pattern as a Shardblade, and summons Testament as a shield while Iyatil retreats into the room with the other Ghostbloods. Shallan sees herself as Radiant actualized as she steps into the room. She takes a plain crossbow bolt from Mraize before Iyatil loads it with an anti-Stormlight bolt causing Shallan to step back through the threshold as Ghostbloods escaped out a second exit in the room. Shallan dismisses Pattern and Testament out of concern for them telling Pattern to go bring the strike team. She tries to delay Mraize and Iyatil's escape by speaking about Mishram directly to them through her Plate-amplified voice, but her tenuous argument is met with an anti-Stormlight bolt from Iyatil. This causes Shallan to breathe out all her Stormlight and dismiss her Plate before taking the bolt in her rib cage. The anti-Stormlight is injected into her bloodstream via [[Raysium]] on the tip of the bolt and it feels wrong to Shallan but is not actively harming her since she is void of Stormlight. She does not draw any Stormlight in to heal while watching the strike team descend through the ceiling of the room. Mraize, Iyatil, and Lieke are wrapped in a voilet-black light and vanish just in time.

'''Kaladin''' 

Kaladin prompts Szeth to continue the story after the horn sounded, but Szeth refuses for the time being. Kaladin and Szeth exit the forest and lash themselves over the rolling grassy hills of Shinovar proper. They discuss the differences of trees and grass in Shinovar and Kaladin thinks about how flimsy the homes look. Szeth then notices a darkness emanating from one of the ten [[Honorblade]] monasteries by the mountain cliffs and comments on how something is wrong there.  After a brief mention of the Unmade Szeth encountered here in Shinovar in the past, Kaladin and Szeth set up camp.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan is in agony over being shot by a crossbow bolt and intentionally not healing with Stormlight as her team pursues the other fleeing Ghostbloods. [[Darcira]] rips the bolt out of Shallan's ribcage at her command. Shallan waits for the anti-Stormlight to dissipate before finally breathing in some Stormlight to heal. Darcira tells Shallan that the team got delayed as they caught panicked Ghostbloods retreating through the back exit tunnels before arriving to Shallan's location. Shallan considers Mraize, Iyatil, and Lieke escaping to Shadesmar and thinks about the first time she entered [[Shadesmar]], which she vaguely remembers is not actually during the events in [[Kharbranth]]. She peeks into Shadesmar and sees Mraize, Iyatil, and Lieke escaping toward an Oathgate platform to pursue Ba-Ado-Mishram through Dalinar's entry into the Spiritual Realm. She thinks about how she should not be able to enter Shadesmar but must be able to because of her double bond with both Testament and Pattern. She pulls herself fully back into the [[Physical Realm]] and decides to go to someone who can help her catch the Ghostbloods. 

'''Lift'''

Lift is teaching Gavinor bad words and is speaking with him and [[Wyndle]] about members of Bridge Four she finds attractive while they wait in the war room just outside the private conference room full of plants that Dalinar and Navani are in. She considers how [[Zahel]] went missing and was absent from the singer invasion in the tower and thinks he was wise to stay out of it. Lift reassures Gav that his grandparents, Dalinar and Navani, care about him and aren't able to spend time with him right now only because they're very busy trying to save everyone. She also tells him that you have to figure out what's right and wrong for yourself and not necessarily because someone said something is right or wrong. Lift then asks the Sibling if they've seen the red bird Mraize was hunting but the Sibling says they haven't seen it. Wyndle tells Gav about spren relationships and how they can have similar roles, like partners and parents can be to that of humans, before Gav solemnly recounts how his mother, [[Aesudan]], gave him to the [[Voidbringers]] and his father, [[Elhokar]], died trying to rescue him. Gav swears his vengeance against anyone responsible for killing his father and Lift consoles him. Lift, thinking it wasn't appropriate to force Gav into a mature line of reasoning about his comments, is confronted by Wyndle remarking on her growing maturity instead. She immediately changes the subject and asks the Sibling if spren personalities vary. The Sibling replies yes and their conversation progresses to the Sibling telling Lift that microorganisms live all over her body much like humans live within Urithiru with Lift finding this fact both gross and awesome. After thinking about how much Wyndle puts up with her, Lift extends hers and Gav's secret handshake to him which is met with great enthusiasm from Wyndle. Wit, Dalinar, and Navani emerge from their private conference with Aladar and Sebarial and move towards the lifts. They bring along Gav to spend a little time with him. Lift, fully loaded with food from the war room, decides to follow them.

;Plot Summary

'''Renarin'''

Renarin is outside Urithiru watching Rlain tend the crop fields. He considers how Rlain's efforts are somewhat moot now that the tower is awakened and the crops are fairing much better with proper temperature and humidity control, but Rlain is still helping the humans regardless. Renarin is staring at Rlain fondly when [[Drehy]] lands nearby and delivers a report to him. Drehy asks Renarin about his feelings toward Rlain. Renarin discusses how his aunt, Navani wants grandchildren and how he's unsure about how to approach Rlain with how he feels. Drehy comforts Renarin and tells him that nobody is normal so you should live your life according to what's right for you. He tells Renarin that he can ask him any questions he has about his sexuality since Drehy's been where Renarin has been before. He also encourages Renarin to confront his feelings and approach Rlain because it's better to know where things stand instead of leaving them unexplored. He lashes himself away before making sure Renarin is coming to the Bridge Four dinner that evening. As Drehy flies away, Renarin experiences a vision portending things to come. 

'''Rlain'''

Rlain considers his preferences for different singer forms and how his bond with [[Tumi]] allows him to be himself and control the way he thinks despite what form he's currently in. He then notices Renarin inside a vision so he steps into it with Renarin. Renarin is overwhelmed with joy at someone else being able to see and experience the stained glass possibilities within the vision that only he has had experience with until now. They examine the different possible outcomes, knowing that only one possibility will actually occur, before [[Glys]] tells Rlain that the visions are prompted by swells in the rhythms of Roshar and that old gods watch them. They see a variety of visions, including one of Renarin wearing singer clothing, one of the [[Everstorm]], one of Dalinar facing something golden over a pit, one of twelve figures in Shinovar, and lastly one of a femalen Fused. Suddenly, the femalen singer acts chaotic, trying to break out of the glass, and multiplies her face across the glass while tuning the Rhythm of Agony and promising to break all. The rest of the glass windows shatter and reform with images of burning and broken things before shattering again. Renarin immediately grabs Rlain and pulls them both out of the vision, where Renarin mentions this is a first occurrence and is glad to not be the only one with these abilities anymore. Shallan arrives and recruits them in her search of Ba-Ado-Mishram in the Spiritual Realm, prompting Rlain to believe the face the two just saw in the vision was Ba-Ado-Mishram's.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan, some Windrunners, Renarin, and Rlain all enter Shadesmar via the Oathgate where Shallan views an awakened Urithiru for the first time in the Cognitive Realm, in all its vibrant splendor of color and light. Shallan is completely infatuated with the tower's resplendent and magnificent artistry and has Radiant take over. They meet up with three Alethi guards and two Windrunners, [[Isasik (Windrunner)|Isasik]] and [[Breteh]],  who were left in Shadesmar to keep an eye out for Ghostbloods. They report no sightings of any Ghostbloods. Shallan is intent on catching the Ghostbloods as they try to enter the Spiritual Realm when Dalinar does. She speaks with Renarin about how Sja-anat has been playing both sides in her allocation of corrupted spren to bond. Shallan catches sight of a soft red glow around Renarin which she determines must be his spren. Renarin spots the two Bondsmiths, glowing much brighter than surrounding souls in Shadesmar, descending the tower in a lift. They move out to intercept Ghostbloods near Dalinar and Navani.

'''Navani'''

Navani and company head down a lift to attempt their first entry into the Spiritual Realm with nightfall approaching. She comforts Gavinor and assures him that Urithiru is alive and inherently good, evidenced by Urithiru providing them all with such a large array of daily comfort and functionality. The party moves through a tunnel and down some stairs into a large water cistern chamber to attempt their breach into the Spiritual Realm. Wit brings out a rock from Ashyn during the time of the human migration to Roshar. This rock is to be used as an anchor in the Spiritual Realm so that Dalinar and Navani may see a vision of the human migration and corroborate the events with Wit as a control trial. Wit then directs Navani and Dalinar to tether themselves to the Physical Realm using Stormlight before explaining that they need to use their intuition and feeling to bring their minds into and navigate the Spiritual Realm. 

'''Shallan'''

Radiant, Rlain, Renarin, her two Windrunners, and three guards fly to Urithiru in Shadesmar and approach the room Dalinar and Navani are in so that they can closely watch for Ghostbloods. Renarin confronts Radiant and says he saw a vision of Ba-Ado-Mishram so Shallan walks over to hear what he has to say. 

'''Renarin'''

Renarin is overwhelmed by the stimuli in the tower including the vibrant lights, the populations of spren, the flames representing the souls of people, and the constant movement of each of these. He tells Shallan about the vision with Rlain in which they saw Ba-Ado-Mishram, and Shallan mentions she's seen her too thanks to her double spren bond manifesting interesting occurrences. Renarin is hesitant that they might accidentally release Ba-Ado-Mishram but Shallan is set on stopping Mraize and Iyatil from reaching the Unmade. Renarin feels sucked into Shallan's momentum in her pursuit of Ghostbloods, but, despite this, he reflects on his growing fondness for his sister-in-law over the past year. They approach the water cistern room and see the souls of Dalinar, Navani, Wit, and Lift along with one other in the room. Shallan describes Mraize, Iyatil, and Lieke to Renarin intent on trying to understand how and where they will enter the Perpendicularity when she suddenly realizes the three guards they brought match the heights of the Ghostbloods but are disguised with Lightweaving.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar opens a Perpendicularity for himself and Navani to go to the Spiritual Realm. Wit tells them to go in, and Navani says she can hear the pure tones of Roshar as they enter.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan and company are attacked by Mraize, Iyatil, and Lieke. Mraize is weilding a dagger of anti-Stormlight so Shallan shouts for her team to protect their spren. Several fights break out between Shallan's team and the Ghostbloods as Dalinar's perpendicularity is opened. Radiant, fighting with Iyatil,  separates from Shallan, fully armored in Shardplate via a Lightweaving from Shallan, which gives Radiant physical form despite being in Shadesmar. Shallan's training with Adolin preserves her in close knife combat with Iyatil as the spren stay away from the anti-Stormlight threats. Shallan's training proves useful when she disarms Iyatil, but soon after she is immediately impaled in the eye by Iyatil's blowgun while a Windrunner [[honorspren]] impales Lieke with a dueling sword. The Windrunners, Shallan, Renarin, and Rlain end the fight with Mraize lashed to the ceiling, Iyatil surrounded, and Lieke dead. Iyatil then distracts the Windrunners by mentioning the original three guards needing saving while Mraize, in a desperate gambit, throws his anti-Stormlight dagger at the Perpendicularity, causing it to collapse in a room shattering blast.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar and Navani slowly enter the Spiritual Realm still Connected to the Physical Realm. A vision begins to form from the light when suddenly their Connection is severed and their bodies and minds are fully sent into the Spiritual Realm.

;Plot Summary

'''Lift'''

Lift watches Dalinar's perpendicularity from the air shaft tunnel she was hiding in and sees a confident version of herself who isn't afraid of growing up. She yearns for the comforting touch of her mother as she sees this confident version of herself. Suddenly she is interrupted as a hidden Gavinor approaches from behind. She tries to usher him back through the shaft in the opposite direction when both of them are unexpectedly pulled toward the Perpendicularity in a rush. Lift, trying to maintain her footing by deactivating her [[abrasion|awesomeness]], loses hold of Gav as they rapidly approach the Perpendicularity and is almost pulled in when Wit grabs her and keeps her from entering. Wit explains that he doesn't know what happened but that Dalinar and Navani's Connections have been severed. Lift, in a panic, realizes that Gav must have been pulled into the Spiritual Realm when Wit addresses a [[cremling]] with wings. Wit and [[Design]] look into Shadesmar to see if Dalinar, Navani, and Gav ended up there instead of the Spiritual Realm to no avail. Wit then realizes that if Dalinar does not show up to the contest of champions, he will forfeit the contest and the contract will be void, allowing Odium to leave the [[Rosharan system]]. Wit decides that they should not alert the others of what happened to both Bondsmiths to prevent tower wide hysteria.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin's unsuccessful attempt at stew did not have the affect on Szeth he was hoping for. Kaladin tries to reach out to Szeth anyways at Dalinar's behest, but Szeth is not receptive to being helped or any form of self improvement. Szeth believes he deserves to live in misery after the numerous heinous acts he's committed. Frustrated, Kaladin moves off to practice playing his flute as Wit suggested the day before, but this too goes poorly. Kaladin expresses doubt to Syl about his ability to help Szeth to which Syl replies saying Bridge Four didn't start out much differently. Kaladin reflects on his times with [[Rock]] and Teft in Bridge Four and how much growth they all experienced together. Kaladin realizes Syl is right and resolves to keep trying when he notices Szeth trying a bowl of stew. Szeth opens up a little to Kaladin saying he does care for his people and that he and Kaladin will start correcting the wrongness of Shinovar by visiting his family homestead and looking for clues. Szeth goes to sleep and Kaladin and Syl speak with the Wind about how Odium has changed and how, together, they must preserve a remnant of Honor. Kaladin attempts more flute practice when Ishar appears. 


'''Lopen'''

Lopen considers how strange Urithiru looks in the Cognitive Realm as he and [[Rua]] approach the site where Shallan's team was last seen. Isasik shows him the blown up remains of Lieke, and Lopen infers that they must have entered the Spiritual Realm since they haven't turned up in the Physical Realm. Lopen determines that there's nothing they can do for Shallan and her team except keep their machinations a secret just in case it's a covert operation. Lopen expresses concern at what Navani is up to and her lack of concern over her missing family members as he recalls a nonchalant Navani shrugging and eating [[chouta]] when delivering news of Shallan and Renarin missing. 

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin takes in Ishar's vast presence before introducing himself and offering help. Ishar, madly thinking himself the [[Almighty]], arrogantly rejects Kaladin's help and is unwilling to meet with [[Ash]] and [[Taln]] back in Urithiru. Ishar also tells him that, as creator of the Oathpact, he siphons much of the other Heralds' painful burdens, aside from Taln's. Ishar rebuffs Kaladin's further attempts at help and commands Kaladin to aid Szeth in his quest if he wishes for an audience with him again. Ishar disappears, with Kaladin doubtful that he can accomplish this goal within eight days and return to Dalinar. Kaladin prepares to sleep and, with great conviction, thinks positive thoughts and decides he can be successful, as he has been in the past.

A [[Regal]] singer, [[Heshual]], runs off to inform [[Fused#The Nine|the Nine]]. Odium speaks to El, questioning why he would destroy someone he once named friend, and El asks if he really can't fathom it in all his divine wisdom. The two speak of strategies for taking the Shattered Plains, and El confirms to Odium that unless he has access to corrupted [[Order of Elsecallers|Elsecallers]] or a proper Honorblade, the Unmade [[Dai-Gonarthis]] is the best way to bring reinforcements to the Plains, so long as Odium is willing to pay her price. Odium agrees, saying he will pay her price another time, and places El in command of the Shattered Plains forces. El asks that Odium not dub him with a formal title, to which Odium agrees, yet names him ruler, elevating him above even the Nine.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth struggles to find his homestead and discusses his spren allowing him the use of the [[Division]] surge to which his spren replies to focus on the mission and focus on cleansing Shinovar. Szeth and Kaladin find the homestead by foot after Szeth realizes this was how he would normally recognize the area instead of flying with lashings. Kaladin tries to get Szeth to see himself as a person who was wronged by his people but Szeth stubbornly is reluctant to see himself as anything other than a tool used to kill. Szeth expresses his commitment to Dalinar and the law without acknowledging that laws are inherently flawed and changing since they're established by humans. Nightblood then speaks to Szeth and Kaladin about Vasher, [[Shashara]], [[Yesteel]] and how they created him. Nightblood also references [[Vivenna]] and how Kaladin should seek her out. Szeth and Kaladin arrive at the homestead just as Nightblood reiterates his purpose to destroy evil. 

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin and Syl discuss how Szeth needs help and she mentions the old gods Night, Stone, and Wind. She tells Kaladin that old things are present in Shinovar, like these three gods, and Kaladin continues to vow to help Szeth in this foreign land full of mystery. They discuss Syl being the lone honorspren who broke away from her people, Kaladin now being removed from the Windrunners, and Bridge Four discovering their new roles in the world on this quest with Szeth. Szeth finds the stone from his story and Kaladin explains to Szeth that they're not very different in the roles they've had, to which Szeth explains that they are different because he would have been happy just being a dancer and that Kaladin chose this life. Szeth continues his story about what happened that night the raiders from the sea came.

Szeth and his sister, after gathering their family's flock, hide in the foothills of the mountains where some of their people retreated from the raiders. Szeth helps the cook prepare food now that night has fallen. He uses a wooden spoon, with exact spice measurements on the handle, to cook with precision. After the cook adds more spices to the meal, to Szeth's dismay, Szeth speaks with the farmer about the ability of men to make decisions. Szeth is frustrated to learn that sometimes trial and error is the only way to determine the right action. The farmer comments that the meal was too spicy, the opposite of what the cook thought, further confusing Szeth on the irony and subjective nature of what is considered right. Szeth brings food to his sister and learns from her that [[Molli]] is missing from the flock. Szeth bolsters his conviction and goes searching for Molli alone near the family homestead, in the direction of the raiders.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin and Colot approach Yanagawn and show him deference before Adolin speaks freely about how they need to hold every inch of the Oathgate platform by filling the space with debris and barricades as singers emerge from the control building. Kushkam immediately disagrees and voices his dissent in the Azish language. Adolin's Spiritual Adhesion Connection from Dalinar allows him to continue the conversation in their language. Adolin contradicts Kushkam in front of Yanagawn but ultimately goes with Kushkam's decision, admitting to Adolin after that he would have gone with his decision instead if Adolin was insistent. Adolin promises to help Yanagawn understand more about the current situation by teaching him how to play the game [[towers]]. While Adolin consoles Colot for not becoming a full Windrunner when he was a squire, [[May Aladar]] shows up as Adolin's new scribe. Being someone Adolin almost dated, May is a little cold to Adolin but takes his orders admirably and tells him to speak with her father, Highprince Aladar, before he returns through the Oathgate. Aladar expresses his pride and gratitude for what Adolin and his family have done in the past few years in building the coalition of monarchs and uniting [[Knights Radiant]]. Adolin promises to keep May safe and Aladar departs through the Oathgate. Adolin moves to don his Plate, as the singers are approaching within the hour.

Szeth approaches the homestead where he sees three Shin men sitting on the large stone eating a freshly roasted meal by their fire. The men were Farmer's soldiers. They noticed Szeth approaching and drunkenly berate him for not being grateful that they protect their people from the raiders because they are men who subtract. Szeth realizes that they have been drinking his father's wine reserves and have cooked his beloved Molli for their dinner. Szeth tries to attack the man with sunken eyes in a rage but is easily thrown aside. Szeth, landing on the small stone from earlier, picks up the rock before hesitating to attack. One of the soldiers slams Szeth to the ground and Szeth responds by bludgeoning the man to death with the stone. He hears a voice in his mind asking what he is before cradling Molli's bloodied pelt until dawn.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth and Kaladin approach Talmut's monastery and find it mostly abandoned. Szeth conveys to Kaladin that it is the burden of the few to protect the many as they are Radiant, to which Kaladin disagrees. They approach some of the buildings and find people hiding inside, fearful of the soil swallowing them. Kaladin and Szeth discuss eliminating an Unmade if there is one present in Shinovar so that they can fulfill their quest. Szeth tells Kaladin that the Sacred Truth of the Heralds is knowing that the singers would one day return and that this is why the Shin kept and trained with the Honorblades. Szeth and Kaladin approach the great hall of the monastery and find [[Rit]] present with Taln's Honorblade. Szeth tells Kaladin not to intervene and that he must rise to this challenge as Rit approaches to fight. 

'''Adolin'''

As singers emerge from the control building, Adolin jumps off the archery platform ring and engages the enemy with his shards near the point where the Azish fortification was weakest. In a whirlwind of Shardblade engagement with the enemy, he burns out the eyes of several different forms of Regals before three Heavenly Ones exit the control building. As May's archers fire at the Heavenly Ones, Adolin continues to lay waste to the enemy singers with help of his Shardbearer support squad. The archers successfully drench three Heavenly Ones with oil and set them afire with flaming arrows before another Fused is impaled by Adolin's Shardblade, with Maya having extended a few extra inches to hit the gemheart. Suddenly the singers surge forward in the company of [[Abidi]] the Monarch who recognizes Adolin and engages him.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth fights Rit, who bears a [[Stoneward]] Honorblade, inside the monastery great hall, with Szeth using the surge [[Gravitation]] only. Rit is making the entire room transform between solid and liquid stone in chaotic patterns and motions, trying to encase Szeth. Szeth dodges with his lashings and engages Rit, all while amazed at her skill and her substantial use of abilities without running out of Stormlight. Szeth's intention and commitment to the fight impresses his [[highspren]] and Szeth allows himself to be encased in stone to draw out Rit's location. Even still his spren does not grant Szeth permission to use Division. Szeth holds his position within the stone encasing him, panicking, but remaining resolute. Szeth's highspren praises his committment and worthiness and finally allows him to use Division. Szeth immediately breaks free from the stone and alights the stone and air into fire as he drives his Blade into Rit as she approaches his previously immobile encasing. Rit's body dissipates into black smoke without any blood. 

'''Adolin'''

Adolin, in Shardplate, engages Abidi the Monarch, who is wielding two aluminum-lined maces, with the former taking a strike to the helmet. Warform singers topple Adolin. His support squad comes in to retrieve him, but he is able to get back up on his own. [[Hmask]] faces off against Abidi. Adolin distracts Abidi by throwing Maya at him. Hmask stabs Abidi in his side, causing Abidi to push him over while advancing on Adolin. Abidi recognizes Adolin and announces his title and purpose, giving Adolin time to set his stance. Adolin's support staff moves backwards to give him room to fight, with Adolin helping Hmask back to his feet. After a short clash Adolin realizes he can't win and withdraws from the battlefield. He watches as Kushkam considers, then dissmisses, the idea of loosing the bags of oil, instead giving an order to hold the current position. With support from crossbows above and Adolin in Plate, the human line is able to hold strong against the singers. Abidi directs the singers to retreat into Shadesmar. Adolin recognizes that Abidi, a Heavenly one, is unable to fly because Adolin nicked his gemheart earlier. Adolin reasons Abidi avoids simply being reborn because of the chance that it'll take too long and he'll miss out on the battle. The Alethi withdraw, leaving some Azish troops inside the dome in case the enemy reappears.

Szeth wonders if he is lying by not telling Kaladin about the Voice. He and his spren suddenly find themselves in Shadesmar sinking into the bead sea. He makes use of his past training and Stormlight to form a pillar to support himself. Pozen reveals himself to Szeth and explains that he must be tested for the position he seeks. Szeth is attacked by the Edgedancer Honorbearer who has come to help Pozen. On hearing a voice, Szeth asks his spren for a weapon, but the spren is hesitant to help in the combat. Szeth realizes that the voice he heard was Nightblood. Szeth realizes that the Honorbearer does not know that he can heal with Stormlight and stalls for time. The highspren returns with a bead for Szeth to manifest, but it is only a wooden spoon. Szeth lashes himself deeper into the bead ocean, and returns to the surface with Nightblood. Nightblood, as perceived by itself, glows golden and is used unsheathed to defeat and kill the Edgedancer Honorbearer. Knowing he cannot defeat Szeth in combat and that Szeth never learned to create an Elsegate, Pozen falls on his own sword, trapping Szeth in Shadesmar. Szeth uses his devotion to his quest to create an Elsegate and return to the Physical Realm. There he warns his spren that he has seen through the illusion of competence that the highspren was putting on.

A schism arose among them, as all evidence presents, but not of this nature.

As Adolin visits various camps, he reflects on his ability to remember people’s names and how it inspires others but also pains him when they die. He listens to the men and notices how much they struggle with the siege defense after only three days. Adolin attempts to boost morale by telling stories about mishaps and prior victories. He knows that this differs from how Dalinar would inspire via ideals and kingdoms but believes his method will remind the soldiers they must fight for each other. Adolin arrives at an area to help with recruitment of new members to reinforce their lines. While the Azish require entrance exams to join the military, Adolin has called any recruits in the Alethi tradition of draft. Adolin begins weeding out recruits, starting by size. He comes across a recruit who has filled out the required Azish paperwork to "live as a man". Adolin welcomes the man for his smithing background. After walking through the recruits, Adolin has Colot pick others for their skills in areas other than the front line. A young girl complains about being made a messenger. The girl, Zabra, wanted to be like the legend of Aqqil. Adolin gives the girl a pike and runs into her to show her that despite her wish to fight, she cannot hold a line against an attacker. Adolin explains that Zabra would be a detriment to the army because she cannot stand yet. He encourages her to run messages and learn where she fits in the army. Adolin sends the girl to May and explains that she can learn archery. Colot informs Adolin he must prepare for a shift in the dome when the bells go off indicating an assault has begun.

'''Venli'''

The stones tell Venli to watch them while the chasmfiends sing, and she sees the patterns forming in the sand. Venli accelerates the process using the surge of [[Cohesion]]. The pattern based on the singing of the chasmfiends recreates the Shattered Plains. Venli notices [[Stormstrider|Stormstriders]], a type of spren, in the storm and also sees listeners who go to find new forms. The stones tell Venli to return to Narak and show her how the Natan people built Narak around the same time Urithru was built. Venli ponders how the city was built without Radiants, and the stones reveal that the location had "alien stones" from a "fourth moon". The stones refer to the event as not happening recently which Venli attributes to their poor temporal awareness. The stones speak to Jaxlim and Thude as well, inviting them to the center of the Shattered Plains.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar travels with Navani and Gavinor to the next vision. They find themselves among the heralds on the other side of the mountains. Based on the appearance of the heralds, Navani and Dalinar conclude this must be the day the Oathpact is founded.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin appears in a vision inside a tent. Glys informs Renarin that Dalinar is present in this vision. Jezrien enters and asks Renarin if he and Ishar are ready. Renarin asks Ishar about immortality who after being pressed admits that he is worried about aging. 

'''Dalinar'''

A passerby once again comments on Gavinor being a spren. Dalinar tries to find an anchor that will be able to guide the group through multiple visions across centuries. Dalinar observes the warcamp and how it differs from modern ones. Notably, a gemheart is discarded. As a highstorm comes near, Dalinar braces for the impact. The Wind reveals that the prayers of the humans of this time allowed the storm to be diverted. As the wind of the storm passes, Dalinar feels a warmth and hears a pleasing tone. 

'''Renarin'''

Renarin regrets not implementing a signal that would allow the others to identify themselves in the vision. A woman enters the tent, and she hums to a rhythm, revealing herself as Rlain. Rlain guesses that the events of the Oathpact and the emprisoning of Ba-Ado-Mishram are connected which is why the Ghostbloods have followed Dalinar. Rlain hopes to find out what happened to the singers. Renarin agrees that a singer should be involved in finding the prison. Renarin reflects on how at ease he is around Rlain before the singer asks if he can touch Renarin to calm his own nerves. Renarin thinks about asking how Rlain feels about romantic involvement with humans but decides it would be too awkward and ruin their moment. Renarin attempts to use his Lightweaving to reveal who is who in the vision. The light reveals a singer who is half in the human world and half in the singer world. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar watches the rain and rockbuds around him. The Wind warns that this mild rainfall is not typical of the storm and that it feared the storm during this time. Gavinor asks the Wind why it is being kind to the humans and it responds that everything on Roshar thinks and has choices. Dalinar joins Jezrien and hears Nale report that El, a singer friend of Jezrien's, has returned as a Fused. Chana agrees with Ishar that Passion has betrayed the humans. Jezrien retorts that their god has always been Odium and not Passion. Navani interjects to find out it has been forty-three years since the last vision. Dalinar realizes that he can use the Honorblade of Kalak granted at the founding of the Oathpact as an anchor to continue traveling through visions.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin shares his vision of light with Rlain. Renarin encourages Rlain to make his own decisions despite what he may think is fated. Rlain attempts to copy Renarin's Lightweaving while Renarin observes the camp. He thinks how Jasnah would enjoy the scene and notices that Gavinor is accompanying Dalinar and Navani. Renarin attempts to gain information using his Lightweaving but continues to struggle. He notices the group including his father approaching the tent and asks Rlain to dismiss his light. However, the singer has produced a vision of him and Renarin kissing.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar follows Jezrien to the tent overhearing a conversation between Battar and Nale. Nale is ready to leave the group, but Navani encourages him to stay and share his information. Jezrien reveals that Navani is not standing in for [[Vedel]] but for Midius which Dalinar recognizes as a name for Wit. Nale is furious that [[Pailiah]] is Lightweaving as it goes against a sworn oath. Navani is surprised to see Vedel and recognizes her as the key to the Herald’s immortality. Jezrien asks Vedel to show the group what is to be done.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin panics as the group enters the tent, and he is reprimanded by Nale. He is happy to see his father yet disappointed that he cannot reveal himself. Jezrien asks Renarin to show the group and they wait for Renarin's response.

;Plot Summary

'''Renarin'''	

Renarin wants to retreat as he usually does in uncomfortable situations, but knows that not saying anything could signal his enemies. Glys realizes that he can provide the original dialogue from the vision, allowing Renarin to know exactly what to say. This comforts him as he can participate without having to worry about alienating others. Glys asks if Renarin truly would give up his indivuality to always know what to say. He struggles with expectations and who he should be according to those who he loves. Gavinor deviates from the vision which Renarian realizes could be used to detect who is a Ghostblood based on these deviations.

'''Sigzil'''

Sigzil and his forces fight [[Kai-garnis]]. The thunderclast breaks through a wall of Narak Four and the Radiant forces attempt to slow her down. Sigzil manages to stop the creature but not before it has caused significant damage and provided a bridge for her forces to cross the plateau. Sigzil commands the troops hold despite the broken wall and summons for the Stormwall. After an Edgedancer falls to a Focused One, Sigzil engages with it. Sigzil confirms that the bands on their body can stop even a Shardspear. After watching some more, Sigzil determines that the potential energy from the Focused One’s wrist is used to power a grip, crushing a soldier’s head inside a helmet. Dami, the Stormwall, arrives carried by a Windrunner. The Riran has sworn the fourth ideal uses shardplate and a large shield to hold back the enemy. The troops begin to panic because the Focused Ones seem unbeatable. Vienta tells Sigzil that her calculations indicate that Four Lashings should be sufficient to kill a Focused One which Sigzil then demonstrates. Sigzil finally responds to Leyten’s spanreed which he has been ignoring and hurries off to meet the man.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar worries about the other’s reaction to Gavinor’s question, but the others continue the conversation. Jezrien reveals that only Vedel survived from her nation on Ashyn. Renarin, as Vedel, is torn about picking a god when Tanavast appears in the tent.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin leaps into his armor to charge into battle. He notices that the pieces seem to lock onto him while getting ready. Kushkam has left a note indicating that the forces may be pushing to fall a Shardbearer. He notices that Hmask is once again in his honor guard despite it being his off shift. Adolin enters the dome and sees the corpses of Fused left as in the singer tradition. Adolin’s thoughts drift to Shadesmar and Maya. He aids the lines where soldiers are struggling to push back the enemy assault. Gamma worries that the pike blocks are no longer as effective, but Adolin sees the relief his attacks bring to the men. Adolin warns his men of a surge against him, and he is correct when later on Direforms swarm him. Adolin stands his ground with Mountainstance and begins fighting the offensive. Someone warns Adolin that the other Shardbearer has fallen due to the enermy’s use of aluminum. Adolin decides to charge and put himself at risk to try to save the other Shardbearer. As he charges, Adolin realizes that the voice is not one of his men but is Notum in the Physical Realm. He maintains his momentum through the enemy fortification and continues charging through the dome crashing through singers and the lines of the enemy. Notum guides Adolin to the Shardbearer and he is able to block a hit on the downed man. Adolin then uses the direform he has overtaken as a club to hit other enemies. The enemy falls apart seeing this display of force and strength. Abidi asks Adolin why he hides his Radiant powers. Abidi threatens Adolin before retreating with the rest of the forces. Adolin is shocked to see Hmask has followed him on the entire charge.

;Plot Summary

'''Navani'''	

Navani is shocked to see the god she has worshipped all her life. Tanavast is chastised by Chana for bringing destruction to Ashyn. He warns that Rayse has started giving power to the singers and that the humans will lose without help. Chana asks what will happen to Passion if their plan succeeds, and Tanavasts answers Chana that Odium will always try to destroy them. Navani is amazed she gets to witness this historic event despite it being different from how she imagined it. Tanavast informs the group that they must have not nine but sixteen or ten people. He also informs them that their Surges taken and then regranted. Tanavast agrees with Jezrien that the nature of being locked on Braize means someone must volunteer for the position. Ishar volunteers, but Jezrien states that as king he should be the first to swear the oath. Jezrien swears to Honor that he will protect the land. Jezrien absolves Nale of his debt and Nale agrees to join his former enemies in aiding Honor. After eight of the Heralds have sworn their oaths, the group turns to Navani as Wit to join them. Navani knows he would not join and rejects the offer. Nale recommends another volunteer outside of the kings and scholars gathered.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin walks through a highstorm as if it were a normal rainstorm. He and Szeth travel to the next monastery. Kaladin asks Szeth if he knows the story of Fleet, but the man does not want to hear the story. Kaladin worries about Szeth not making progress but does not want to push him. Kaladin’s thoughts go to Tien which comforts him despite his brother’s death. Szeth thanks Kaladin for the tip about guarding his thoughts. Kaladin discusses how he sees the pair as similar, but Szeth rejects this because he does his duty while Kaladin questions his. Szeth suggests changing his oath from following Dalinar to following Kaladin, but Kaladin discourages this idea. Szeth then reveals that he has decided he must die for his crimes and face justice. Syl informs Kaladin that the spren are not abundant in the storm and the two discuss Szeth’s progress. Kaladin struggles with Szeth not wanting help. The two arrive at the next monastery.

'''Renarin'''

Glys informs Renarin that Shalash has deviated from the script. Rlain and Renarin try to figure out what to do now that they have identified someone else in the vision. However, it turns out to be Shallan. Glys reveals that Pattern cannot feed Shallan the script because Honor did not encourage spren to communicate to Radiants through their mind. Shallan repeats what Renarin tells her to match the vision and the two discuss how the guards must be the Ghostbloods. Shallan reveals she identified Renarin by his fidgeting. Renarin prepares with Shallan as the group leaves to find Taln. Suddently, Honor attacks Renarin.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Radiant hears Renarin call out and realizes Mraize has taken the place of Tanavast. She spars with Mraize using an anti-Stormlight knife. Rlain and Renarin attempt to help her, but Mraize easily outmaneuvers them. Radiant warns Rlain to be on the lookout for Iyatil. Mraize shoots a dart into Rlain’s eye and manages to stab his throat. Renarin and Rlain retreat outside of the vision. Radiant rushes in and takes a knife to the arm while stabbing Mraize in the chest. Shallan heals her arm while Mraize recovers. Mraize pushes Shallan to consider why Ba-Ado-Mishram has not already been freed and what the Ghostbloods seek. She realizes that Odium must be afraid of the Unmade which is why the prison has been maintained for centuries. Mraize offers to work with Shallan who asks Radiant to support her. Radiant tells Mraize that the reason Odium fears Ba-Ado-Mishram is because parents should sometimes fear their children. Formless appears and commands Shallan to kill Mraize along with Dalinar. Formless continues saying that Shallan will hurt all those close to her. Shallan panics and asks to be pulled out of the vision. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar reflects on the oath he has just sworn in the vision. He intends to keep it even if it was only a part of the vision because oaths are important to him. Dalinar is surprised to see Taln looking less formidable than as a Herald and tending for the horses. Jezrien reveals that Taln has interacted with the gods through an attempt to kill Cultivation. Ishar summons Honor and Nale introduces the god to Taln. Dalinar voices how different Taln is from his expectations and Taln quips that Kalak must still be upset about a weapon lent and lost. Nale argues that Taln represents a different world from the other Heralds. Taln rejects the offer of immortality because he fears living through the ages. Honor thinks that Taln is wise and a good choice to stand against Odium. Taln swears to protect the land but not for Honor. Ishar swears the last oath, and Honor swears an oath back to the Heralds. The group returns to the tent and is offered Honorblades from Honor himself. Dalinar uses that Light as a connection that will carry him through the Desolations to the death of Honor.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan watches the vision from outside of it. Veil comforts Shallan for growing and Shallan retains control. She worries about the information that Mraize has gained and why Formless was appearing in the Spiritual Realm.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth reflects on his fondness for the monastery despite his hatred towards it in the past. He informs Kaladin that the river is always present because of snow melts. The pair find a woman in a building and ask her where the people have gone. She informs them that most were sent to the [[Bondsmith monastery]] to watch for Szeth. Szeth hears Nightblood talking to and learning from the Honorblades. Kaladin suggests talking about the Unmade that Szeth met to try and identify which one is influencing Shinovar. Szeth enters the monastery and returns to the acolyte rooms where he lived. He finds his bunk and finds a wool toy he had hidden so many years ago. As the light shines into the room, he begins to cry.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin sees Szeth crying and assumes that the toy belongs to his younger brother. However, Syl informs Kaladin that the toy is Szeth’s and that he is the one who was a child sent to war. Kaladin realizes that Szeth’s similarities are not to himself but to Tien. Kaladin leaves the room and discusses the assumptions he has made with Syl. Kaladin resolves to help Szeth not because of the past but because he understands the pain. Szeth suggests the pair travel to the Edgedancer monastery next. Kaladin tells Szeth that he is not to blame for the killer he was forced to become. Szeth argues that he still committed a murder regardless of the circumstances. Kaladin adds a third rule, that Szeth deserves happiness. Szeth asks why and Kaladin responds that Szeth’s parents loved him and would want him to be happy. Szeth and Kaladin argue about Szeth’s ability to make choices and knowing what is wrong. Kaladin pushes Szeth to choose his own path. Szeth worries about not knowing what is right and that he cannot to be trusted based on past actions. Kaladin counters that Szeth always knew what he was doing was wrong, and that he can do better in the future. Szeth admits he wants to stop killing and hugs Kaladin. Kaladin feels a sense of relief and wonders if this is what Wit meant by therapy. Szeth reveals that his spren left that morning feeling embarrassed at its unhelpfulness in Shadesmar. This worries Kaladin who thought Szeth had been listening to his spren earlier in the conversation. After Syl gives Kaladin Szeth’s sheep toy, Nale appears to accompany the group having been informed by Szeth’s spren that Szeth needs more direct guidance.

;Plot Summary

'''Adolin'''

Notum discusses his decision to follow Adolin and aid the humans despite not wanting to bond a Radiant. Notum reveals that he heard a feminine voice encouraging him to fight. He then was brought to the Physical Realm and flew to Azimir. Colot is shocked that Notum regained consciousness after a single day compared to the years it took Syl. May wonders how Notum can have consciousness when he is resolved against a human bond. On request, Adolin appoints Notum head of the messenger corps. The two attempt to shake hands but Notum eventually bows when the handshake feels incomplete. Adolin’s thoughts drift to reading and his father. He thinks of Shallan on her mission against the Ghostbloods and is saddened at how long it may be until they may see each other again. May is surprised that Adolin listens to Shallan discuss science and teases him that he never listened to her when they courted. They move on to discuss reports from Urithiru which indicate the troops on the Shattered Plains are managing despite lack of Stormlight and that Navani indicates Shallan and Renarin are both aiding the effort. Adolin leaves for an appointment with Yanagawn worrying about Maya and holding the siege for five more days. 


'''Sigzil'''

Sigzil stealithly advances towards Leyten’s position. He is informed that the attack on Narak was pushed back and that the enemy is temporarily withdrawing. He knows that eventually they will have to cede Narak Four, but that holding it buys them time for holding the crucial plateaus. Leyten reports that Heavenly Ones were spotted in the area and trying to guard the region. Sigzil leads a small group through the chasms to the area Vienta notes is being guarded. Sigzil notes that the chasms have less bodies in them from his time as a bridgeman and that perhaps they are recovering from the constant fighting. At the north edge of the plains, an army is gathering including regals. The group discusses how the forces could have arrived without being spotted with Weiss suggesting it could be Lightweaving. At first, Vienta has no theories for how the army has appeared but then admits it could be done using Elsecalling. Sigzil decides to fly higher up to get a better glance of the troops and the light emitting from the middle of the army. He sees soldiers pouring out of a violet circle which he confirms with Vienta is an Elsegate. Vienta also informs Sigzil that this means Odium is working with Dai-Gonarthis which was thought to not be a possibility because of Dai-Gonarthis wanting to destroy the world. The other possibility, that the enemy has the Elsecaller Honorblade is equally terrifying. Vienta and Sigzil share a happy moment discussing the experiments they could run if they had access to the power of Elsecalling. Snapping back to the war at hand, Sigzil continues watching the portal and spies Moash, with glowing eyes, leave the portal.

The group makes their way to the Lightweaver monastery, marking the halfway point in their journey, and Kaladin tries to reinitiate conversation with Szeth. Nale interrupts and verbally spars with Kaladin over morals and the laws of men. Nale explains that humans first came to Shinovar using Elsecalling and following the sacred tones of Roshar, and that the first laws were forged by God and his chosen monarch, Jezrien. Kaladin is frustrated that he is unable to argue effectively. Szeth renews his mission to kill despite his earlier revelation.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth feels lonely. Nightblood asks if Szeth is evil and they discuss the enigmatic nature of good vs. evil. The homes around the monastery are all empty. Szeth enters the monastery and sees a group of 30 identical women with the appearance of Shalash standing in rows in the center of the hall. The Honorbearer, Moss, explains that he is hiding amongst the illusions, almost all of which are imperfect in some way. To win, Szeth gets one chance to kill the one (Moss) who is hidden behind a perfect face. Szeth must not touch or speak to the illusions. If he fails, his pilgrimage will end here.

'''Venli'''

Venli follows a hidden song, leading a group of twenty of her people and several chasmfiends through the chasms. Thude questions Venli's plan and Venli apologizes for everything that she has done. Timbre says that Eshonai was free of Odium when she died, reinforcing the idea that it is possible to break away from his influence. Venli wants to join the fight ahead at Narak, but Thude gets her to agree to no more fighting. In total, their group of singers only numbers about one thousand adults, while the chasmfiends have just over one hundred individuals. Venli attunes Peace and continues to creep inward.

;Plot Summary

'''Szeth'''

Szeth considers the various Lightweavings of Shush. He finds differences, but is unsure which would be perfect. Sylphrena offers to help, and as it was not strictly forbidden by Nale, Szeth accepts her help. First, she points out that each difference occurs in the distribution of fourteen of one and sixteen of the other. Szeth considers striking at the one with all of the rare traits, but then reflects that Moss was too clever to make a puzzle that simple. Szeth assumes that Moss will want to make a game with no winning choice, but Syl points out that no riddle is truly impossible. Szeth flies above them to get a better view of the group, to look for a pattern. However, it occurs to him that the floor of the monastery bears a mural of Shush, which he deduces must be the only perfect depiction. He strikes through the eye of the mural, killing Moss. Syl remarks on how impulsive it was. Szeth retrives the Lightweaver Honorblade and reflects on the necessity of making decisions.

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah goes to a temple in Thaylen, dedicated to Talnenat, to reflect on why Odium is attacking the city. She finds it troubling how the new Odium is acting and finds problems in Odium's plan, such as diverting his forces while strategizing to get the coalition to split up theirs. After speaking with Ivory, she realizes she forgot to examine her premises. After doing so, she determines that the ships coming towards Thaylen City are not guaranteed to have troops, and hurridly sends the Windrunner scouts to re-investigate.

;Plot Summary

'''Syl'''

People flood out of the monastery, falling to the ground in relief at their freedom, but Syl cannot stop worrying about what Moss said. He had mentioned that one of the standing illusions was deadly...All of a sudden, Kaladin summons his spear and stabs an acolyte through the head right as they are about to strike at Szeth with a Blade. The Truthwatcher, Vambra, collapses and burns away just like the others. Nale argues that Szeth is cheating since he has received help from Kaladin and Syl. Szeth retorts that there are no rules for this campaign, and that if there were, they would have already been broken several times over by the Honorbearers themselves. Nale concedes that he is wrong. He describes how the Windrunner Honorblade has been corrupted by Odium and Vyre, and so there are only three remaining Honorblades for Szeth to claim. Kaladin and Syl reaffirm their commitment to live for themselves and follow their own paths.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan paces fabricated rooms in between visions in the Spiritual Realm. Glys says that the anti-Light should be more deadly to their enemies' spren rather than humans. Rlain and Renarin flirt while Shallan misses Adolin. Shallan worries about Formless, but Pattern reassures her that many important people around her are still alive, and that Shallan has only had to kill the ones who tried to kill her first. Shallan is good and not inherently dangerous to those around her. The group plans to send a Lightweaving into the next vision while they watch and wait for an opportunity to attack.

;Plot Summary
'''Sigzil'''

Sigzil meets with the generals and realises that the enemy will not want to capture the Oathgate, wanting instead to break the defenders and let them flee. He convinces the generals to use Narak Three -- a supply depot -- as a distraction, tricking the enemy into attacking there instead of overwhelming Narak Prime. Sygzil calls in Stargyle and creates a plan to lightweave gemstones on Narak Three. After the meeting, Sigzil asks Vienta if the remaining Stormlight will last three days, which she doubts. Sigzil then sits with Leyten and reminisces about the chasms. Leyten doubts if he is a true Radiant, but Sigzil convinces him that since he trusts Kaladin's decisions and doesn't blame Kaladin for anyone's deaths, he should trust himself and not blame himself. After saying this, Sigzil realises that he is a man that can lead.

'''Venli'''

Venli remembers her childhood as her group marches through the chasms. Timbre wonders if the reason that the meeting of the Highstorm and Everstorm at the [[Battle of Narak]] was so violent was because they met over the Shattered Plains, or because it was the first time the two storms had converged. After the Chasmfiends lift the singers over an obstruction into waist-high water, Leshwi wonders to Venli if she is strong enough to continue being seperate from Odium's power, but Venli tells her that she is their last defense if Odium's army finds them, and that the listeners will find a place for her. The Chasmfiends notice an abandoned bridge wedged high in a chasm, and Venli projects in the mind of Thundercloud what the bridge would have looked like when it was new.

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah receives a report that the holds of Odium's ships are filled with stone, revealing that the army invading Thaylenah is a fake. Fen and Jasnah argue about this discovery, with Fen fearing that it was a ruse disguising a real plan to take Thaylenah. Fen leaves to talk to the Thaylen Central Council, as Jasnah begins to draw up orders to reinforce the Shattered Plains.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan wakes in a vision of her past with white carpet, then forcibly changes the vision to a day as a child, hiding while her parents shout at each other. Shallan's mother walks past her, and Shallan sees red-and-gold hair and hears her muttering. Shallan doesn't follow, but after discussion with Veil and Radiant, accepts the memories. She walks under the stairs, finding all her brothers except [[Helaran Davar|Helaran]] hiding there, and tells them a story. This cheers up her brothers, and after she leaves them, she finds Testament on her wall, drawn to Shallan by her lies, especially that she is happy and strong, not terrified. 

'''Renarin'''

Renarin has a vision of himself at a feast when he was younger. He sits at the children's table, despite being the oldest at it. He gets up to find the bathroom, but runs into a group of older boys with firemoss, taunting him. He notices something that he hadn't seen when he originally experienced this day: they are afraid, testing the limits of what they can do with the child that Dalinar was ashamed of. Renarin, remembering Zahel's training, sweeps the legs of one boy, then braces himself to be attacked before Adolin runs up and protects him, challenging one of the boys to a duel and ensuring that Renarin is okay. Renarin explains to Glys that he wanted to train to be a soldier not to be like Adolin, but to not need to rely on Adolin helping him. 

'''Rlain'''

Rlain has a vision of a meeting in Narak during the [[War of Reckoning]] with Eshonai, Thude, Bila, [[Harvo]] and [[Tusa]]. Eshonai fears that they are losing listeners too quickly, and Thude suggests that they send spies in dullform to find out when humans are sending patrols. Thude volunteers, but the others refuse him, as well as everyone else there except for Rlain. Rlain then volunteers, and everyone agrees that he would be a good choice. He reminisces on the events after this day, his failings to pass significant information to the listeners, and he remembers how once in Bridge Four, he would think about how no one in the meeting had protested to his volunteering.

'''Navani'''

Navani walks on the plateau in front of Urithiru, wondering why the tower began to fail. She breathes in Stormlight and tries to sense the rhythms of the tower, but instead notices a faint line of Connection. She touches it, and communicates with the present-day Sibling, who does not think they can pull her out of a vision. The Sibling explains that the in-fighting of the Radiants was worse at this time, and that Melishi withdrew from them, researching present-day-style fabrials. They suggest that Navani and Dalinar follow Garith to learn about the Recreance. Navani loses the Connection, and talks to Dalinar, who is surprised that the knowledge of the origin of humankind on Roshar was known of this early. Navani manages to create a Connection to a woman, showing that perception changes Investiture, and Dalinar successfully places Navani in her place. She manages to then create a Connection to the events of the Recreance in the same way, and they transport themselves to a battlefield with Radiants as Garith enters a tent.

Kushkam hazily shouts for reinforcements as Deepest Ones stab his soldiers from the ground and Heavenly Ones drop boulders. Rahel heals Kushkam, and he orders soldiers to protect her, then sees part of the dome explode, Fused stepping out. He sends the order to drop the firebombs inside the dome. 

'''Adolin'''

The thunderclast ignores Adolin's honor guard, focusing on Neziham. Adolin grabs the other end of the chain and attempts to wrap it around the thunderclast's other leg, tripping it. It kicks, flinging Adolin through the air on the chain until he falls to the ground. He gets up and Nezihem glances at him, distracted enough for the thunderclast to crush him. It snaps the aluminum chain.

;Plot Summary

'''Adolin'''

Adolin lies on the road. He remembers when Renarin fought a thunderclast in Thaylen City, and thinks about his now being obsolete. Hmask tries to help him up, and he remembers the people that he has mattered to, and the people in Azimir who need him. He stands, picking up a length of aluminum chain and Neziham's Shardblade, and asks it if he can use it for a while. He calls Gallant and begins riding towards the thunderclast. 

'''Shalash'''

Ash sits beside Taln, holding his hand. It has calluses, part of his Identity that manifests when he gets a new body. Abidi enters the hospital, and Ash stands up, before sitting back down, shaking. Abidi orders the wounded killed to demoralise the defenders. Taln goes silent and stands up. Abidi flees, and Taln runs towards them to fight. 

'''Adolin'''

Adolin climbs on top of the watchtower and leaps onto the thunderclast's back. He hooks himself in place with the chain hook and stabs Neziham's Shardblade into its back, though it doesn't die. He holds on as the thunderclast tries to shake him off. He grabs the Shardblade and is flung back and forth by the aluminum chain. His Shardplate tells him to grab a part of the thunderclast, and he then jumps, landing on the thunderclast's head and stabbing the Shardblade through its neck, killing it. It topples, crashing on top of Adolin.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin floats in the Spiritual Realm, unafraid. Glys hides within Renarin, and Renarin focuses on his surroundings, forming it into a series of stained glass windows. He notices Shallan, and then Dalinar and Navani, in windows, before sensing Ba Ado Mishram inside one. He sees her emotions and relates to them, talking to her. She admits that she sent visions so they'd find her, and then she could destroy them. She withdraws, and Glys explains that they will need a powerful Connection to reach Mishram's prison. Renarin steps through Rlain's window, finding him sitting in a small building in Narak. Renarin talks with Rlain about his experiences in this vision, feeling unwanted. Renarin shares when he felt unwanted as well, and decides to ask about singer relationships, especially with humans. Rlain mentions his embarrassment with Harvo while in mateform. Renarin and Rlain hold hands, and Glys informs him that Shallan is watching and squealing. They banish the vision and return to where Shallan now is.

;Plot Summary

'''Adolin'''

Adolin wakes after being healed by Rahel, missing his right leg. He learns of the fighting in the city and loss of the Dome. With help from Hmask, he stands and begins moving. He arrives at the medical quarters, finding dozens of dead Fused. His troops find Kushkam alive, and then discover Taln dead on top of a pile of corpses. Ash, leaning beside him, says she's not letting him go alone, then dies. Adolin sees Abidi and singers back inside the dome, shaken from the firebombs.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar stands at a parley of human and singer troops, recognizing that they are here not for battle but for peace talks. He transports him, Navani and Gavinor into the center group, where Garith and other Radiants stand at one side of a table covered in maps, with Regal singers on the other side, and Melishi, Nale and Kalak at the back. Garith and a direform Regal argue about the amount of land the singers should receive for peace. After no decision is made, the singers withdraw, and Radiants sit around the table. Garith insists that the singers will agree to peace with more time, and the Radiants accept this, acknowledging that he has kept the Radiants together even without Urithiru. Garith then insists that Mishram is more reasonable than Odium, and Dalinar suspects that he has been talking with Mishram. After talking about Honor, Melishi states that he will not interfere. Garith leaves, and the Wind tells Dalinar to follow. Melishi tells Dalinar, who is appearing in the vision as [[Naze-daughter-Kuzodo|Naze]], that tonight is the night to reveal Garith as a traitor. Dalinar accepts, and pulls on the line of connection that appears. 

Dalinar finds himself lying on the ground with Navani, Gavinor, Melishi, Kalak and others, just outside a clearing. He notices Gavinor listening to something. Garith and other Windrunners arrive in the clearing. Dalinar notices Garith's stress of keeping a people united, and relates to it, accidentally shifting to Garith's place in the vision. Three singers arrive in the clearing, including the direform. She steps up to Dalinar, bends forward, and kisses him.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin accepts that he will not return in time for the Contest of Champions, and feels at peace. He slowly plays the flute, Syl lying beside him. Nale mentions that he hates the song, but does not explain why, instead eating a ration bar and mentioning that it is the perfect food. Szeth nears Kaladin and requests stew. As Kaladin prepares it, Szeth talks to him about the two choices that he has, between Nale's ideas and Kaladin's. Kaladin tells Szeth a story about his time as a slave with Goshel, another slave who disobeyed orders to burn a village. Szeth realises that Kaladin is trying to get him to think about commands that should be disobeyed. Szeth gets up and walks away, and Kaladin restrains himself from following. Syl feels something change in their bond. 

12124 sits down beside Kaladin and requests his services, worrying that what he's doing with Szeth feels wrong. He confirms that this is his first bond, and that the other highspren are disappointed. He wonders if he should have joined the dissenters, then asks for advice. Kaladin tells him to talk to Szeth and to not be hard on himself. 12124 complains, but says he feels better. Kaladin notices Nale in the air, and mentions to Syl that he doesn't want to help Nale. The Wind explains that Nale hates Kaladin's song because it was a rhythm, a song the Heralds heard that brought them to Roshar, and that part of Nale wishes that they died on Ashyn. The Wind insists that the Heralds need saving, and that it needs a champion. The Wind shows Kaladin memories of Nale as a hero for millennia, now weathered by time. Szeth runs over and shows Kaladin a river of spren in the sky flowing towards the north-east.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan gets Glys and Tumi to place herself, Rlain and Renarin in a vision of the rocks where she saw the starspren, a point of light in an otherwise dark trip. Renarin discusses how he talked to Mishram, and Rlain suspects that they'll need to find her and move her prison before the Ghostbloods find it. They discuss their visions, but can't think of anything out of the ordinary about them. Shallan admits to them, and herself, that she changed her vision, which was going to be the day she killed her mother. Glys tells Renarin that Dalinar and Navani are at the day that Mishram was captured, and Renarin decides that they need to enter the vision.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar is kissed by Shmone, and she seems concerned by his reaction, but is assured he's alright. She tells the other Windrunners about her relationship with Garith. Dalinar plays along with the story, insisting that singers are people, just like them. Part of him feels that he could learn something from Garith. The other Windrunners doubt that the entire nation of singers is willing to make peace, and Shmone warns Dalinar that Mishram has agreed to come. Mishram appears in the shape of an ordinary singer, shocking Dalinar, with the current-day Mishram trying to break out through. Mishram notices the other humans, and Melishi walks up to her with a gemstone. Shmone wonders if Melishi can be persuaded to join their cause, and Dalinar realises that no one understands what is about to occur. Mishram explains that she infused herself with Odium's power while he is trapped on Braize, and Melishi agrees with her desire for peace. Melishi hesitates, and Honor orders him to proceed. He uses his deep connection to Mishram around a desire for peace to draw her into the gemstone. 

Dalinar swaps back to someone with Navani, and feels a ripping in Roshar and freezing of Roshar's tones for three seconds. When it ends, Honor stands beside Melishi, and the singers collapse, losing their forms until they resemble parshmen. Garith demands an explanation, and Melishi says that Honor said this would provide peace. Melishi cowers behind Honor, who states that this was necessary. When Garith touches him, every Radiant gets a vision of the Radiants destroying Roshar. Honor compares them to Dawnshards, stating that Radiants will end Roshar. Dalinar understands now why the Radiants broke their oaths, to avoid this vision. The Stormfather takes Honor's place, and says that they have seen too much. He casts Dalinar into the Spiritual Realm, where Odium looms over him.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin kneels beside Shmone as Garith cradles her, recognizing why Mishram hates them. Rlain thinks she's wrong, because if she simply hates humans, it's what Odium wants: a clear distinction between sides; people can be wonderful or terrible, but an enemy is just someone to fight. Shallan and Rlain walk over to Dalinar, while Renarin tells Garith that he'll fix this. Somehow, Garith sees him and nods. The vision breaks apart, Glys forming it into an expanse of black stone. Rlain mentions that he saw Melishi take a perpendicularity which Pattern says went to the Spiritual Realm, where he was lost with the prison. Renarin mentions needing a connection to Mishram, needing to know and feel her. Glys informs him that Sja-anat was there during the imprisoning and felt pain for them. Before he can think about that any further, he sees Formless. Shallan worries that she should be more in control, and insists that they go somewhere stable. Glys struggles to do so, realizing that it's Odium's influence. He appears, discovering them and casting them into the mist.

Lift is fed up with pretending to be Navani. Wyndle insists to her that the explosion wasn't her fault, and that Dalinar and Navani will have found Gavinor. Lift explains that she wants to be part of stuff, since she was one of the first Radiants, but that when she does join in, she messes everything up. The Sibling asks what peeky time is, since they heard someone say it. Lift explains, and the Sibling re-creates the voice, which Lift realises is Gereh's Aviar. Lift gets the Sibling to cancel the illusion of Navani and goes to the room with the Aviar, which is surrounded by aluminum. Lift cuts a hole in the floor of the room and enters, finding the Aviar in a cage and Zahel chained up. Axindweth and two others walk in, and Lift plans to leave with the Aviar. However, she changes her mind, and tries to fight the three, sliding into a bookshelf and bed. She feels stubborn and mad, feeling that she'd failed too much already, and uses her powers to slide onto the wall, utilising Abrasion to both decrease and increase friction. She then increases friction on the floor as Axindweth uses Feruchemical speed, breaking her legs. Zahel compliments her raw power, a statement that shocks Lift. He insists that she needs a teacher. That night, she decides that if the world is changing, she needs to change with it. She returns to Zahel and asks how to start.

'''Sigzil'''

Sigzil fights as Narak Three falls, retreating and leaving uninfused gemstones so the Fused think they forced the Radiants to use it during the retreat. General Winn joins him after the fight, and Sigzil asks him how he deals with loss. He says that there aren't good answers, but that Sigzil did a good job dealing with it during the battle. They worry about the remaining stormlight, which will likely run out today, and Sigzil calls a planning meeting. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar floats in the Spiritual Realm, seeing himself destroying distant worlds. He finds himself as Rortel in the Kholinar Palace on the night of Gavilar's death, bringing wine to Dalinar. He speaks with Jezrien who is at the Beggars' Feast. Dalinar refuses to bring wine to himself, and continues talking to Jezrien, who becomes more lucid. He insists that Dalinar not lose himself. Dalinar walks to the feast hall, and the younger Dalinar demands wine to stop hearing Evi. Dalinar slaps the younger version of himself and tells him that Gavilar is dying. The younger Dalinar gets up before collapsing unconscious. Odium speaks to Dalinar, wondering if it hurts to see the younger version of himself. Dalinar insists that he keeps taking steps, and Odium throws him into another vision, the moment that Dalinar found Gavilar's body. He realises that it still hurts, even now. Dalinar finds Gavinor as the vision collapses again, and Dalinar tries to console him, insisting that there will be peace. Gavilar doubts it, and says that he needs to be a soldier like Dalinar. Dalinar asks Honor's power what happens if he wins. He sees possibilities insisting that mankind will break the peace that is created, Odium taunting and demeaning the humans until they demand retribution. Dalinar says that he need Honor so that he can have the strength to deal with Odium, ending the war. Odium laughs, saying that Dalinar just wants power, and casts him into the dark, relentlessly assaulted by visions.

'''Kaladin'''

As Kaladin nears the Dustbringer monastery, he wonders if Szeth will choose to fight or refuse, disliking the situation that Szeth had been placed in. He admires the scenery, then gets into an argument with Nale surrounding the merits of old laws. He realises that arguing with Nale logically won't help him, and instead decides to get Nale talking about his time as a Herald, and the best parts of that time. Nale reminisces about his first rebirth, how he was convinced of the need to be a Herald by that time, and of how he was the light that stopped the darkness. Kaladin tries to push Nale to keep talking, but Nale immediately refuses and stops. Szeth mentions to Kaladin that the focus now is stopping the Unmade in Shinovar, which Nale agrees with, mentioning that Szeth is Truthed, a Bearer of Honor. Nale walks away, and they arrive at a small town which has been corrupted. Kaladin insists to himself that although these people need help, if Szeth wants to stop they would need to accept it and find another way.

'''Venli'''

Venli's group arrive at the central plateaus of Narak, noticing the battle happening above them. Venli feels her destination at the heart of Narak, and wonders if she's being deceived. The Five decide to vote on whether to continue. Leshwi insists that they should continue, as since they are so few, they would need some way to resist Odium. Leshwi's eyes begin to glow as she accepts the power that Odium offers to all Fused in this area, and is upset at her willingness to take his power. The Five vote unanimously to continue, and they arrive at the plateau, where she realises the beating is below the ground. She shifts the rock below her, creating a tunnel leading far beneath the ground, with a light at the end. 

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah and Fen have agreed to send their Radiants to the Shattered Plains, leaving their conventional troops in Thaylen City. She worries about the coalition, where too few troops are in Azimir due to the shattering of the Azish Empire. She compares it to a coalition in Thaylenah which struggled when resources were limited. Odium coalesces as a black mist in her room, wondering how she noticed the empty ships. He insists that he is not here to hurt her, but to compliment her on this. He reveals himself to be Taravangian, and states that he has come to personally see that Thaylen City falls by tomorrow evening.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth arrives in the Dustbringer Monastery as Nightblood chats to him. Nale admits that the previous Honorbearer has died, and a new, younger one has taken her place. Szeth insists to Kaladin and Syl that he doesn't want help, since the Dustbringer's abilities were ones which he excelled at. He speaks to 12124, who is uncertain about how to best help Szeth, then sees the Dustbringer Honorbearer. He dismisses his sword, stating that he will not fight, and dodges all of the Honorbearer's attacks, although 12124 worries about it. He hears the Honorbearer's voice, realises that it is Elid, his sister, and stops dodging, instead sitting on the ground. Elid can't bring herself to kill Szeth, and explains that his Truthless nature chased her for her whole life. They embrace, and she continues talking, mentioning that this pilgrimage is a test to see if he can take Jezrien's place in the Oathpact, before forcefully being turned into smoke. Szeth, angered, talks to Nale about this news, who insists that no one asked for the burden of being a Herald, so there was no need to tell Szeth this. Syl then argues with Nale, confused about his justification for fighting with the Singers while trying to destroy them. Nale insists that there are two monasteries left, and mentions that he has not been fighting the living during these fights. Szeth, shocked, says that this idea of him becoming a Herald is an impossibility. 

'''Sigzil'''

In a meeting room on Narak, Sigzil and others worry about the significant casualties they have taken in this battle. Sigzil asks for their options for defense, which seem very limited with their lack of Stormlight. An argument around the contest of champions and Dalinar breaks out, but Sigzil interrupts, asking if anyone has any ideas. No one has any, but they insist that they must continue. They plan how to arrange their troops on the remaining two plateaus, then finish. Sigzil consults with General Winn, who estimates a ten percent chance of success. Sigzil admits that he has an idea, but that he hasn't figured out exactly how he could do it. Winn trusts him, and promises him more time. Vienta doubts the feasibility of his plan to lure the Fused into completely abandoning the plateau so they don't hold it on the deadline, which Sigzil agrees with, but he feels that something like it might work. Vienta apologises, admitting that she can't stop thinking about Ethenia's death. Sigzil stands, looking out through the rain. 

'''Venli'''

Venli's group finds a glowing golden pool of light underneath Narak Prime. Timbre explains to her that she had seen a pool like this in the mountains, a gateway to another realm, and Venli realises that this must be Odium's pool, which she found by being bonded to both a spren of Honor and one of Odium. She also presumes that Odium sent his best troops here so that he controlled the pool after the contest. A guard arrives and informs them that the Heavenly Ones have been discovered by the singers and Fused.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar finds himself in Elhokar's body, facing a mirror. He sees something in the mirror and remembers that Wit told him Elhokar was on the path to Radiance. He feels what Elhokar felt at this time, and realises that what Elhokar needed was someone to listen. A younger Dalinar walks in to the room, and current Dalinar realises that this is the day he beat up Elhokar to prove that he didn't want him dead. Current Dalinar fights back, the younger Dalinar being suprised and assuming that Elhokar expected this. He hears Elhokar's thoughts that Dalinar will be a better king, and current Dalinar insists that the failure is his, although it will take Elhokar dying to realise it. Current Dalinar opens the doors to get the guards to help him, but younger Dalinar knocks him down, explaining that they're his men. Current Dalinar notices that one of the guards is Gavinor, who has just seen Dalinar beat up Elhokar. He realises that Odium wanted Gavinor to see this, and the vision ends.

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah stands before Odium, and theorises that either Odium is tricking her, or Taravangian has become Odium. Odium explains how Szeth came to kill him, and unknowingly allowed him to Ascend. Jasnah accepts that it seems to be Taravangian. Jasnah has no idea what to do, confronted with a being of such immense power. Odium says that he has an offer which he is also presenting to Fen, clarifying that tomorrow he will argue with Jasnah, attempting to recruit Queen Fen and Thaylenah willingly. He asks that she prepare her arguments well, and disappears.

'''Venli'''

Venli stands on a plateau with El and Leshwi's Heavenly Ones, and is surprised to not be afraid. She is also surprised at El's politeness, as he discusses how the mark of their best often is shown by those who rebel against Odium, as they are the ones with the strength to turn against a god. El offers Venli the chance to become a Fused, and to have the other pardoned, in return for attacking the humans with the chasmfiends. Venli demands to speak to the others before making a decision, which El accepts, before threatening her that Odium plans to deal with her people otherwise. Leshwi apologises, but insists that this pardoning might be a way out, if what El has told her is true. Venli doubts this, but understands that it might be their only way to avoid utter annihilation.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan accepts that she needs to see the day that she killed her mother, and it coalesces in the Spiritual Realm. She stands as an adult in her room - although she was eleven at the time - on a white carpet. She looks out a window to see herself at eleven in the garden, speaking to Testament. The younger Shallan admits to being afraid of the future, not wanting anything to change. Shallan questions Pattern as to why they decided to bond such a young child, which Pattern explains was mostly due to a lack of preconceptions, but also her mother. Shallan walks to the door of her mother's room, where younger Shallan is listening, and pushes the door open to see her mother talking to Nale via a Seon, who wants her to join them in Kholinar. Seeing this, Shallan accepts that her mother is the herald Chanarach. Nale and Chana argue about her new life, which Nale calls a dupe, and he insists that if she does not kill Shallan, then Dreder - the Skybreaker with the Seon - will. The younger Shallan gasps at the door, and with Testament realising the danger, begins to flee. The older Shallan stays in the room, listening as Chana insists to Dreder that Shallan has taken her powers as a Herald, and that she is mortal. Dreder calls her insane, and follows her as she leaves. Veil and Radiant insist that she is able to see this, so she follows as Chana and Dreder enter her father's chamber. After an argument where her father is restrained by Dreder, Chana holds Shallan to the ground, grips a knife, and hesitates. Older Shallan asks, and Testament confirms that the hesitation happened. Chana's face softens, but younger Shallan's Shardblade manifests, and she kills her mother, followed by Dreder. Shallan forces herself to keep watching as younger Shallan throws her Shardblade away, and her father consoles her. Pattern admits that he feared this day would break her, but Shallan explains that it simply cracked her, and she filled those cracks. She decides to blame her mother, although she does want to forgive her. Pattern mentions again that Shallan's mother is Chana, and is therefore still alive. Shallan agrees, and tells him that Chana was at her wedding.

Szeth arrives at the Bondsmith monastery, a section of ground with rock formations rising around it. He notices the stone divots where the nine Honorblades would be placed, kissing the stone where Taln's blade would have been. He thinks about Taln, being glad for the delay to do so, since a part of him is afraid. He speaks to the Voice, admitting that he doesn't trust the other Honorbearers, but trusts the Voice, since if he doesn't, he doesn't know what's left. The Voice, pleased, guides Szeth into a cavern as it explains that every Honorbearer presents themselves here to ask for approval. Szeth senses something dark in the cavern, which the Voice insists is untrue. Szeth finds a room filled with spren nailed to the wall with crystal spikes. Szeth stumbles back, shocked as the Voice explains that it can transform them into better versions of themselves. A darkness begins to coalesce into a human form. Szeth decides that this is one of the Unmade. He considers accepting it anyway, but remembers Neturo saying that he can be trusted to decide. Szeth turns and flees.

;Plot Summary

'''Adolin'''

A surgeon attaches a peg to Adolin's leg as he stares at his missing foot. Adolin tries to convince himself that he was lucky, because the thunderclast had only crushed his foot, and that it would be healed later. The surgeon explains that it will take time to learn how to balance, and that Adolin should be permanently relieved from combat. Adolin thinks about the thin lines surrounding the dome, then returns to the imperial tent and finishes a game of towers, which Yanagawn wins. Colot checks on Adolin, which he finds humiliating despite being his orders for the wounded. Adolin then explains his plan to give Yanagawn more difficult tower games, and asks for Gezamal's opinion. Yanagawn explains that Gezamal had been reassigned for standing with him to fight instead of disobeying him. Adolin expresses his contempt for this decision, then plays more games of towers. Colot later tells Adolin that he has found Gezamal, and Adolin goes to offer him a position in his guard. 

'''Szeth'''

Szeth ponders Nale's desire for Szeth to become a Herald, feeling numb and pressured now that death may not be an out for him. 12124 greets Szeth, and asks to speak with him while Szeth listens to Kaladin's flute-playing. 12124 explains that Nale gave Szeth Nightblood as a test of character, which he passed, then talks about the honorspren bond, which he finds friendlier than theirs. He continues, discussing the consequences of being a Herald, and the suffering that will occur if the Oathpact is not reforged. Szeth, feeling crushed, says that he will do so, but insists that Nale is broken, and that the tests are irrational. 12124 says that he wants to help, and that he is willing to bear his costs as well, as he will be tortured along with Szeth on Braize. He admits that he has many of the same questions about the trials that Szeth does. 

'''Adolin'''

Adolin hears a report from Notum that the lines are holding with high casualties, and expects the hammer to fall tomorrow. He regrets not being able to help. He and Colot find Gezamal cleaning latrines, and attempt to tell him about his disgust at his reassignment, but Gezamal refuses to hear it or to leave, explaining how he loves Azir despite its flaws, and that accepting his punishment is a mark of respect for the empire. Adolin walks away, and Colot discusses his experience being refused as a Windrunner due to his eye color, wondering if he stayed as a soldier for similar reasons to Gezamal. Adolin hears the fighting again, and thinks that they won't last long enough.

'''Venli'''

Venli and the Five are deliberating over whether or not to accept Odium's offer of service and attack of the humans. The words "''I am my own. Not his''" play in her mind. Estel suggests that they accept his dominance but not allow themselves to become Fused, keeping with the spirit of the listeners. Thude says that they cannot, as rejecting Odium is what defines them. Venli comforts Leshwi upon her feelings of anger from Odium, saying that she no longer needs to be afraid. Venli then realizes that she had sworn oaths to help people in bondage, and she asks the Five if she can speak.

'''Navani'''

Navani is in the past in [[Shulin]] when she was eleven to settle some accounts. The other women laugh at her ineptitude with writing. Navani, with the true benefit of hindsight, says that this episode of the past has no power over her, since she has faced that fear. She is thrown out of the vision in to the chaotic mess of the Spiritual Realm with the intent of finding Gavinor and Dalinar. She sees a pattern to the mess, that she is being directed into painful moments in the past. As she is cast into another vision, she guesses that it will be a vision with Gavilar in it. She realizes that the visions all allow her to get her footing for a bit before sending the painful parts at her. Gavilar enters the room angrily, telling Navani that she undermines his authority. Gavilar moves to slap her, and Navani says that since he didn't hit her in actuality, his slap now would break the illusion. She realizes that she has exerted a bit of control over the vision through this observation. Telling herself to focus, she realizes that she may be able to steer the vision to where Gavinor might be. She tells the vision that what would hurt her the most would be if she witnessed Elhokar's death. The vision changes from her study into a room in the palace of Aesudan on that fateful day.

Instead, he dismisses his Blade and walks into the room Sivi is meditating in, confronting her with the horrors he witnessed when he met the voice in the Bondsmith monastery.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin makes breakfast. Syl comments on the food and tells him how she distrusts Nale. Kaladin takes out his flute, calling the Wind, who admonishes Syl for calling Nale a creep. The Wind says he is just weathered, like a stone. The Wind tells the two of them to touch the stone Kaladin is sitting on, and Kaladin receives an impression that the stone was formerly a grand statue. He sees the years of weathering and erosion, and the Wind says that while Nale has been weathered, a part of him, like the stone, remembers who he used to be. The Wind says that Kaladin needs to help Nale remember, that they will need him -- and all the Heralds -- in the days to come. Szeth comes over, smiling as he picks up his plate, and tells Kaladin that they should get moving to the penultimate monastery.

'''Sigzil'''

Sigzil stands on the wall of Narak Prime, Odium's forces assaulting it with themselves and thrown stones. The Stonewards are using up all of the Stormlight to keep the wall intact, but the enemy still has ample reserves of Voidlight. Sigzil fights off some Husked and Magnified Ones, the former of the two asking him where Kaladin is so they can fight him. Lopen finally arrives with twenty Windrunners, who chase away the last attackers of the wave. Lopen tells him that half of his Radiants had to stay behind due to lack of Stormlight. Vienta tells Sigzil that they are at their limit for Stormlight -- if they use more, they won't be able to get their army back through the Oathgate. As he walks back to the command post, Ka gives him a message: Venli has contacted them. Her offer of more troops won't help the battle, but it may be able to save them a different way.
