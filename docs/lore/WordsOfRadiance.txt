;Plot summary
:''Six years ago''
Jasnah leaves the feast celebrating the signing of the Alethi treaty with the Parshendi. On her way to a clandestine meeting that she had scheduled, she notices her shadow pointing the wrong way. Her shadow slowly returns to normal, but she is disconcerted. This is not the first time this has happened to her, and she wonders if she is cursed. As she continues, she observes a group of oily black figures materialize before her. Jasnah then transfers to [[Shadesmar]] for the first time. She almost drowns in the sea of beads before figuring out how to form the beads into the shape of one of the palace hallways. One of the figures approaches her drawing a sword and Jasnah manifests a statue of [[Talenel]] to protect herself. The figure bows to her while his companions whisper to each other, and Jasnah is transferred back to the Physical Realm. She notices that the lanterns near her have been drained of [[Stormlight]].

She hurries on to the meeting, where she tells the assassin [[Liss]] that she only wants her brother's wife, [[Aesudan Kholin|Aesudan]], watched for now. Jasnah reminds Liss of their first agreement, according to which Jasnah will match payment of any offer made against a member of her family, in exchange for the name of whoever tried to have them assassinated.

As she leaves Jasnah hears the Parshendi's drums cease. As she walks she encounters [[Nale]] and [[Kalak|another man]] discussing an individual named [[Shalash|Ash]] as well as what Jasnah believes is a Shardblade. Continuing on, Jasnah hears screams and starts running, following a trail of destruction that leads to her father's rooms. She watches as [[Szeth]] collapses the balcony beneath himself and [[Gavilar]]. She begins to cry as he stands over her father and wonders what he is doing. When he walks away she sees that her father is dead, his blade having appeared next to him, and despairs over failing in her efforts to protect her family.

Members of the Parshendi ruling council, including [[Klade]], [[Gangnah]], and [[Varnali]], approach Jasnah and apologize. They confess to hiring Szeth to assassinate Gavilar, claiming he was about to do something very dangerous.

;Plot Summary
:''Tanatashah 1173''
The chapter opens with Shallan sketching [[Shadesmar]] aboard Tozbek's ship, The Wind's Pleasure, sailing south of Roshar. While sketching, she notices a pattern appear on her sketch. This marks the first time [[Pattern]] manifests in the physical realm, appearing as an embossed sequence of complex lines with sharp angles and repeated arrowhead shapes. The appearance of Pattern startles Shallan, causing her to drop her sketches which Yalb collects for her.

Shortly thereafter, a scout spots something in the water which turns out to be a [[Santhid]] - a large, rare sea creature viewed by sailors as good luck and whose shell is the only thing anyone ever sees. Seeing an opportunity, Shallan decides she needs to sketch the first ever picture of a living Santhid. After much debate with Yalb and Tozbek, and after conversing with Jasnah about [[Shadesmar]] and [[Spren]] in some detail for the first time, the sailors finally agree to allow Shallan to be lowered over the side of the boat to get a look at the Santhid. Jasnah tells Shallan that she has spoken to Navani about the possibility of repairing the [[Soulcaster]] Shallan possesses so that her brothers can give it back to the [[Ghostbloods]]. Shallan is also informed that she has been betrothed to Adolin Kholin, which she accepts willingly.

;Plot Summary
:''Tanatashah 1173''
Kaladin rides out the first [[highstorm]] since being freed in a small room attached to his mens' new barracks within Dalinar's war camp. Upon exiting the room he is greeted with cheers by his men who have been shaving their beards during the storm with Rock's razor. Kaladin contemplates the betrayals of both Sadeas and Amaram while speaking with Skar, Teft, and Moash about how to proceed training the newly freed bridgemen. There are some 1,000 men situated in 20 now empty buildings in Dalinar's camp; buildings recently emptied after the betrayal of Sadeas and the subsequent loss of soldiers. Kaladin decides they will find the most eager [[bridgemen]] and train them personally, sending them back to pass on their training to larger groups of bridgemen, all of whom have been given permission to leave as free men although the majority of them have not done so. Kaladin says his worst case scenario plan is to have all 1,000 men trained and able to leave the war camp as a cohesive band of mercenaries if it comes to that. Having been named Captain by Dalinar, the highest rank Dalinar dared appoint a darkeyes, Kaladin plans to name Sigzil, Rock, Teft, Moash, and Skar lieutenants. Rock will be quartermaster with Lopen as his second, Teft will be in charge of training, Sigzil will be the clerk, and Moash, Skar, and Kaladin will be mainly in charge of guarding Dalinar, who they have mutually agreed after some discussion, is their best hope for remaining free men.

Later, the men previously of [[Bridge Four]] visit a tattooist. The tattooist sets about covering the slave brands with tattoos of freedom, including some details of who freed them and when. First Hobber decides he wants a Bridge Four glyph added and after this decision, the rest demand the same. Not to indicate freedom from Bridge Four, but to embrace the unity they found there. Even those members of Bridge Four who were without slave brands opt to get the tattoo including Shen, most on their foreheads though Moash chooses to get it on his arm. Finally Kaladin sits for his tattoo but the ink will not take - his Stormlight expelling it - even after banishing his Stormlight until the tattoo is set, the ink immediately melts away when he again sucks in Stormlight.

After leaving, Kaladin and his men walk through the war camp noting the general mood. Kaladin decides the camp has an air of dread to it following Sadeas' betrayal. The men receive Bridge Four salutes from a few people they pass, Kaladin wondering where they even learned the salute. The men visit the head quartermaster, Rind, to discuss uniforms for the bridgemen. Rind hands out what's left of the old [[Cobalt Guard]] uniforms and the men try them on, eventually coming to admire how they look in them. After some discussion with Kaladin, explaining to him that they all identify as Bridge Four despite being free, Kaladin requests that Rind commission new Bridge Four glyph patches for the uniforms.

;Plot Summary
:''Tanatabach 1173''
Shallan sits in her cabin on the Wind's Pleasure reading a book written by Jasnah about [[Vorinism]] and the [[Recreance]] and its effect on the documentation of history, such as the existence of Shadesmar. While studying, Pattern shows up again, this time on the cabin wall, vanishing when she looks directly at it. Shallan notes the similarity between Pattern and the symbol headed creatures she had seen previously. She immediately attempts to sketch the pattern, attracting many creationspren, though she found it difficult to capture the precise pattern. When finished, the pattern seems to leave the paper and move to the floor. Jasnah comes to Shallan's room just as Shallan leaves to find her. Shallan catches a glimpse of what Jasnah explains to her is her own spren, just as she tells Shallan that the pattern is Shallan's spren, a Cryptic. Jasnah explains about the [[Knights Radiant]] and the Orders, explaining that their Soulcasting is a shared surge, but that their Orders are not the same, judging by their different spren. A lengthy discussion of the nature of spren and Jasnah's opinions of the [[Almighty]] and the [[Herald]]s follows.

;Plot summary
:''Tanatakes 1173''
Dalinar is experiencing another vision. He describes how he is running through what he believes to be the [[Purelake]] along with about a dozen armed and armored men, though he notes that they are clad in ancient leather armor. At first he is unsure if they are running away from something or toward something, until he notices a Fortress apparently made completely out of onyx. His group meets up with another one led by a [[Knights Radiant|Knight Radiant]] in deep red glowing [[Shardplate|Plate]]. Dalinar thus determines that this vision takes place before the [[Recreance]]. The Radiant informs them that [[Caeb]] thought he saw something and tells them to look around. When one of the men hears Dalinar mumbling to himself, as he describes what is happening, he tells Dalinar to look for a [[spren]] that isn't behaving the way it should because spren that were touched by [[Sja-anat]] are different. Dalinar repeats the words quietly, hoping that [[Navani]] will record them, when he notices that the female Knight is talking to apparently nobody. As he looks around he sees a face of shadow with red eyes in the water. When he points this out to the others, the Knight, after noting that this is Sja-anat's spy, sends Caeb to the checkpoint and tells the others to keep watching for the carrier. Dalinar chases after the spren while describing it, when it is suddenly joined by a six-foot-tall spren. As the second one dives into the rock, Dalinar stumbles back. He gets pulled back further by one of the men as the ground starts to tremble. Dalinar watches as the spren, having somehow apparently animated the rock, starts to climb out of the rock with its new rock body. The soldiers, recognizing it as a [[Thunderclast]], start yelling for Hammers. 

Dalinar wakes to Navani fervently transcribing the last of his cryptic words before recording Dalinar's detailed description of the vision to be used by his scholars in their attempts to translate Navani's transcription. The two then discuss Dalinar's plans to publish his proclamation as Highprince of War in the next few days, Navani having convinced him to first release the news to the other highprinces in private. Dalinar, exhausted by the growing burden of responsibility bestowed upon him by his visions, falls asleep by the fire following Navani's departure. He wakes hours later, the fire burned out, and rises to attend to his duties. Dalinar stops suddenly when he notices a series of marks newly scratched on the wall to form glyphs, reading "Sixty-two days. Death follows."

:''Tanatakan 1173''

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin and the members of [[Bridge Four]] listen to a crier read Dalinar's proclamation. The proclamation states that all [[Gemheart|gemhearts]] won in battle will now belong to the king, and shares of that wealth will be apportioned at the Crown's discretion. The men are concerned that this will sow even more discontent among the highprinces, making their job as bodyguards to Dalinar more difficult. Kaladin orders [[Rock]] to start training cooks for the other bridgeman barracks, hoping it will make them less despondent, then heads to the [[Pinnacle]] to relieve [[Skar|Skar's]] team. On the way, [[Syl]] worries that Kaladin no longer laughs.

Once at the king's palace, Kaladin is allowed to stay for a meeting consisting of [[Dalinar]], [[Elhokar|King Elhokar]], [[Adolin]], [[Navani]], [[Renarin]], [[General Khal]], and his wife [[Teshav]]. Teshav reports that the highprinces are irate. They had hoped that Dalinar would reconsider, and sending the proclamation out to the public has provoked them. Elhokar says that it is a disaster, and fears that they'll be dead before the week is out. Dalinar says he'll unite the kingdom or destroy it trying. The proclamation was made in order to re-focus the highprinces' attention on the war, and Dalinar did this knowing that it would enrage them. He wants the highprinces angry, to remind them of why they came to the Shattered Plains in the first place. He then announces his intention to "disarm" the highprinces by having Adolin begin dueling for the [[Shardblade|Shardblades]] and [[Shardplate]] in their armies. Lastly, when prompted on his endgame, Dalinar states his intention to refound the Radiants. He isn't sure why exactly he needs to do this, but he knows he has to.

'''Sadeas'''

Meanwhile, Torol Sadeas sits in front of an elaborate stone table with [[Oathbringer (Shardblade)|Oathbringer]] stuck through it. He thinks about how often he had lusted after the weapon, but now possessing it feels hollow. His wife [[Ialai Sadeas|Ialai]] enters the room, and mentions that she has used Dalinar's heavy recruitment drive to place more spies in his war camp. They talk about how the other highprinces hate the proclamation, and plan to fan the flames of discontent. Torol wants conquest. He plans to let Dalinar alienate the other highprinces and fracture the kingdom, at which point he will "forge a new Alethkar from flame and tears".

Shallan sits on the deck of the [[Wind's Pleasure]], bundled up because of the cold. She's observing and taking notes on the complex geometric spren, who she had named [[Pattern]]. Pattern asks about the concept of food and replies, "Terrible! Destruction!" when Shallan describes eating. Shallan notes that Pattern is connecting increasingly complex thoughts. When she asks him about his first memories, Pattern starts to vibrate and Shallan can hear wind blowing through branches, and the deck starts to turn to a dirt path in front of her. Shallan is horrified and the images vanish. Just then, [[Yalb]] comes over and introduces her to "[[New kid]]", a six-foot-tall hulk of a man. Yalb tricks New Kid into doing galley duty for him, which Pattern seems to like. Shallan asks him if he likes lies, to which pattern replies that he likes "good lies ... True lies."

Shallan heads below deck to her cabin where she gets caught up in her research. Hours go by before she closes her books, and her spheres are getting dim. She feels satisfied, her life seems to finally be coming together. She fishes some newly-restored spheres out of her safepouch to replace those in the goblet, but strangely they are completely dun. When she goes to ask Jasnah for some new spheres, Shallan notices that Jasnah is uncharacteristically disconcerted. She seems exhausted, and her poise has been replaced by worry. They discuss the return of [[Surgebinding]], and Jasnah asks that Shallan focus on learning the [[Surgebinding#Illumination|Illumination]] Surge rather than [[Surgebinding#Transformation|Soulcasting]], as the latter can be dangerous. Jasnah also reveals that she is worried about the [[parshmen]], who she thinks are secretly the [[Voidbringers]]. They worry that because the parshmen are so integrated into Vorin society they could cause utter collapse if they rebelled. Jasnah speaks of how in ages past, the [[Herald|Heralds]] would return before [[Desolation|Desolations]] and train the [[Knights Radiant]]. She reveals that she hopes to find a path to [[Urithiru]], the legendary city of the Knights Radiant, in the [[Shattered Plains]]. There she will try to find information that will convince the Alethi leaders to expel the parshmen.

Before Shallan leaves, Jasnah gives her a book that contains information on the [[Order of Lightweavers]]. The book is called ''[[Words of Radiance (in-world)|Words of Radiance]]''. Shallan goes to sleep planning to read the book in the morning.

She is awoken by screams, shouts, and smoke.

Shallan wakes up in a panicked state, and rushes out of her cabin into the passageway. She sees three men holding torches with their backs to her, and one of them throws Jasnah's body to the deck, then stabs her through the heart. She screams, recognizing one of the men as a new sailor, and returns to her cabin, locking the door. The men break down the door, but fail to see Shallan as she manages to draw in Stormlight then create an illusion of shadow to hide in, and another visible moving image for them to chase to another part of the ship. She sends Pattern to spy and he tells her the regular sailors are being killed on the main deck. She makes her way to Jasnah's cabin, surprised to not trip over her mentor's body in the dark. She finds Jasnah's chest and opens it to access her spheres, and hears as the sailors are being murdered. Shallan tells Pattern she wants to soulcast the bottom of the ship to sink it and use the confusion to help the sailors, and Pattern intercedes, giving her passage to Shadesmar. Pattern is there also, appearing like a symbol-head. He tells her to find the bead representing the Wind's Pleasure and persuades it to change and sink so that it can possibly save some of the sailors that it serves. Shallan returns to the physical plane and the sinking ship, and starts going under as she cannot find the way out, then something grabs her, dragging her down.

Dalinar watches as Highprince [[Aladar]]'s army, which has arrived to the plateau faster than his own, fights the Parshendi over a gemheart. Dalinar feels bitter and jaded, as he no longer believes the plateau runs represent the fulfillment of the Vengeance Pact. Kaladin and his guards cross a bridge to guard Dalinar as he joins Aladar on his command plateau adjacent to where the battle is being fought, while Adolin and General Khal lead the Kholin forces to the fight. Dalinar joins Aladar and tells him that he saved the other Highprince from losing, but Aladar complains that he will earn less and that he is being punished for being successful. Dalinar threatens Aladar on the consequences of disobedience, but Aladar counters that Gavilar didn't use honor to unite the kingdom originally, which strikes a nerve. Aladar thinks the Parshendi are about to push, but Dalinar thinks otherwise, and turns out to be correct about them getting ready to harvest the gemstone and withdraw, and they end up victorious. Dalinar notices the Parshendi Shardbearer watching from a distance, having never entered the battle, and states that this has never happened before. Aladar thanks Dalinar for his advice, but refuses to trust him regarding politics since he fears betrayal. Back in his bunker, he notes there are now sixty days left in the mysterious countdown, and receives a letter announcing that an old friend of his would be coming soon to the Shattered Plains and might solve some of the problems Dalinar is dealing with.

Kaladin and Syl stroll off, debating the laws of physics and Syl jokes about her ability to defy gravity. They discuss Dalinar's plan to refound the Knights Radiant, which Syl likes, and the mysterious countdown. Syl mentions dangerous red spren that she sees on occasion.  Kaladin asks if there are other Surgebinders and Syl says yes, and there are other spren of different types doing what she is, but that she is the only honorspren and that she defied the Stormfather to do so. Syl tells Kaladin to be what Dalinar is looking for, and he says that he will try, despite his painful past. Rock interrupts them, praising Syl and offering to build a shrine dedicated to her. Rock says that Teft moved their training to a different spot, and says the bridgemen are becoming less reticent. Kaladin agrees to allow Sigzil to do his testing now to determine the extent of Kaladin's abilities.

Shallan awakes on a rock surrounded by ocean water, just offshore. She sees the santhid that saved her swim off toward the horizon. Pattern says that the ship sank and doesn't know if any of the sailors survived. Shallan forces herself to accept that Jasnah is dead. She manages to tread water and reach the shore. She waits on the beach for a while looking for signs of survivors but sees none. Pattern says that he found someone and urges Shallan to follow him, and leads her to Jasnah's trunk, which contains her books and notes intact in a waterproof enclosure.

Shallan is unable to build a fire, so she decides to try to soulcast one. Pattern eases her into Shadesmar, and she sees large, fuzzy-looking, bird-like spren that hover overhead, which are exhaustionspren that are drawn to her. She takes a bead that represents a piece of wood and tries to persuade it that it could be fire, but it prefers to be a [[stick]] instead. Her sphere is drained of Stormlight and she flees from Shadesmar, having failed to make a fire start. She gets up and starts walking, though her feet are cut up and bleeding, and ends up encountering a group of strangers around a fire, and due to her state of exhaustion, lays down next to the fire and goes to sleep.

Shallan wakes up as someone with a Thaylen accent addresses her as Brightness, but he isn't one of the sailors as she initially thinks. She realizes that they are slavers, led by a man named [[Tvlakv]], and asserts herself as she imagines that Jasnah would, introducing herself and ordering them to retrieve Jasnah's trunk and escort her to the Shattered Plains, overcoming Tvlakv's objections by sheer force of will and gaining his reluctant compliance.

Down in the chasms&mdash;while Teft and Drehy are working with twenty others to train them&mdash;Kaladin, Sigzil, Rock, and Lopen are doing experiments. Lopen guards the location to avoid unbidden guests. They try to measure how long a rock which Kaladin infuses with Stormlight and sticks to a chasm wall stays stuck. Rock hints at spren that pull the stone to the wall. Kaladin sees them too, when looking close, but Sigzil does not.

Sigzil takes notes, writing them down in glyphs. And he is confused. He says he would need a clock to properly measure times and that he has no real references to compare. So they start testing other things, things Kaladin can do in battle with his Stormlight. For example, Infusing his spear and making it stick to the spear of a foe or Infusing the ground causing others that step on it to topple. For these experiments, Lopen and Rock join Sigzil as sparring partners. It's shown that Rock indeed knows how to fight, though he still refuses to do so aside from this sparring for testing Kaladin's abilities.

Teft comes and sees the last part of the sparring. He asks Kaladin to release him from his task of training new recruits, but Kaladin refuses.

When Kaladin and his men leave the chasm, a darkeyed soldier tells him that a hero has arrived at Dalinar's warcamp. When Kaladin hears the man's name, he rushes to Dalinar's command complex to see the newcomer with his own eyes. Kaladin sees Dalinar clutching hands with his old friend, Brightlord Amaram.

;Plot summary

[[Eshonai]] leads the Parshendi as they return to their home plateau after successfully harvesting a gemheart that was brought back by [[Devi]], who is allowed to carry it as a reward for spotting the chrysalis. She wonders where Dalinar is, and feels a need to speak with him, but she can't join battles since her leg is still injured from when Kaladin stabbed her during the [[Battle of the Tower]]. She wanders through the ancient ruins on the plateau they named [[Narak]], or Exile, where her people came to escape their gods. She enters the [[Hall of Art]] to observe the heretofore futile efforts to rediscover a new form for making art, as an incremental step towards discovering other more useful forms, but [[Varanis]], one of her lieutenants, is unsuccessful in trying to attract creationspren to his novice attempts at painting. She contemplates the six current known forms, and laments the loss of the hundreds that their old songs mention, thinking her people may die off if they don't become more versatile.

She leaves the Hall, and encounters three mateforms who are playing idly in a pool, and berates them for being unproductive. She reflects back on how she and the rest of the Parshendi leaders conspired to assassinate Gavilar, to prevent the Parshendi gods from returning, at the cost of the slow annihilation of her people. She returns to her home, and finds her sister, [[Venli]], and tells her of the plateau run and that Dalinar was not present on the Alethi side. Eshonai says that she wants to talk to Dalinar and sue for peace but Venli thinks that he wouldn't accept, and says that she discovered stormform. Eshonai exclaims that this could cause their gods to return, but Venli says that is a moot point since the Alethi now have Surgebinders, though Eshonai isn't sure about this. [[Demid]], Venli's former mate, agrees that they should risk using stormform to protect their people from being wiped out. Venli says she wants to raise the issue with the Five, and Eshonai says she will consider supporting it.

;Plot summary
[[Ym]] is in his shop trimming a small block of wood. The cobbler had been taught to make the wooden forms himself, so he does. It's the way it's been done for centuries, which is good enough for him.

A spren moves in the dimness to his right. It has been coming around more often lately, and Ym had never seen one like it before. As it moves it looks like specks of light, like those from a piece of crystal suspended in a sunbeam. When it stops, light creeps upward from it, like small plants growing, which withdraw when it starts moving again.

They talk briefly about the shoes, and that Ym finds himself needing more shoes for children lately. The spren shakes suddenly, and warns "He Comes." Anxious, Ym stands up looking for "the watcher," a man in a military coat, but finds only a child peering through the door.

Ym invites the urchin in, who's feet are dirty and scraped. The boy is [[Iriali]], with their characteristic golden skin and hair, and walks with a limp. Ym offers him a pair of shoes in exchange for his story. As the boy speaks, Ym cleans his feet to fit the shoes. One of the feet has a nasty cut on the bottom, infected and crawling with rotspren. Ym cleans it and puts on antiseptic, then subtly uses some Stormlight to heal the cut. They speak of Ym's religious beliefs, and the boy leaves after receiving the shoes.

The spren whispers "He's still here," and Ym spins as he hears a rustling behind him. A [[Nale|dark-skinned man]] with a crescent scar on his cheek steps out of the shadows in the back of the shop. The man accuses Ym of commiting a murder in his youth. Ym tells the man that it wasn't intentional, but the man says he is guilty nonetheless, then summons a [[Shardblade]]. Ym runs, but he is old and quickly tires. He stops, trying to pull out a sphere for some Stormlight, but the dark-skinned man slams him against a wall and stabs him in the chest with the Shardblade.

;Plot summary
Rysn is traveling with Vstim to the [[Reshi]] isles to do trading, but Vstim is very sick. Gu, the flotilla's guide, takes them there, guiding them since the islands move. Rysn is quite shocked and amazed when she realizes that the moving islands are huge great shells. The group lands on one of the islands, and Vstim tells Rysn that she must go and trade with the Reshi, as he is too ill to do so. He tells her to be bold, and although Rysn is nervous, she agrees to do so. Kyrlm and Nlent, two of the guards, accompany her as she ascends the island. While Rysn is observing the island, she sees Axies hanging upside down. They talk for a bit, and then Rysn and the guards continue their way up the island.

They make it to the king, and as Rysn approaches to speak with him, Talik, a Reshi trader, comes forward to speak on his behalf. Talik is disappointed that Vstim himself did not come to trade, and initially turns her away. Rysn is insistent in her trade, wishing to prove herself to Vstim, and the king eventually relents so that Rysn is speaking to the king, and not to Talik. The Reshi are opposed to trading with Rysn since they do not yet respect her and do not know if they can trust her. The king eventually dismisses Rysn, telling her that she did very well.

Rysn, worrying that Vstim is dying, instead insists on talking to the greatshell that is the island, [[Relu-na]]. She slides down the side of the head on a rope and begins to talk with it, pleading her case. Talik attempts to bring her back on top of the island, but Relu-na takes a bite of the fruit at the bottom of the rope and breaks it, causing Rysn to fall. As she crashes into the water, Relu-na cushioned her fall, and Rysn fell unconscious.

Rysn wakes up in a hut on the island with her legs paralyzed. She sees Vstim, a Reshi healer, and Talik around her. They scold her for her stupidity, but Rysn insists that it was boldness, to allow for the trade. Rysn realizes that it was all a test that Vstim had set up for her to trade, and feels foolish. Vstim reveals that the trade was for a [[larkin]] corpse, but that Rysn has been granted a live larkin by the island itself. Vstim and Rysn will stay on the island while Rysn's legs heal.

;Plot summary
Eshonai, Thude, and Bila examine a gemstone with a captured [[Stormspren]] inside that Venli believes will allow them to rediscover stormform. Bila thinks that anything that will help in the war against the [[Alethi]] is worth it, but Eshonai worries about provoking the old gods. They depart, and Eshonai decides that she will see her mother. On her way, she sees a group of [[Parshendi]] that have chosen the dull-form, the form most like the [[Parshmen]]. Eshonai questions them on the cause of their transformation, and they respond that they do it so the Alethi will not kill them when they come. Eshonai is concerned by this response but understands that the [[Parshendi]] are free to choose their own forms, as they are no longer ruled by the old gods. Continuing on her way, Eshonai eventually arrives to see her mother, who suffers from dementia and believes Eshonai to be her sister, Venli. Despite her mother's declining memory, Eshonai is still able to elicit some information from her regarding Parshendi history. Her mother tells the story of the Last Legion, the Parshendi warrior-people who rejected the old gods, giving up advanced thought and knowledge of the forms of power in exchange for freedom. This left them with only dullform and mateform, but the Last Legion had composed songs as a way to remember the many forms of old in hopes that they would one day be rediscovered. Before Eshonai leaves, her mother gives her a sack of old maps from Eshonai's days as an explorer, which makes her long for the past.

Eshonai leaves her mother's house to attend a meeting with the Five regarding Venli's plan to attempt rediscovery of stormform. Eshonai is hesitant, expressing her concerns regarding the old gods, but eventually agrees to the plan under the condition that she be the first one to try assuming the new form, as Venli's studies and knowledge of the forms are too valuable to risk undergoing the transformation herself.

:''Tanatakah 1173''

Shallan travels towards the [[Shattered Plains]] on one of Tvlakv's wagons. She sits next to Bluth, one of the stoic mercenaries hired by Tvlakv, who drives the wagon. She distracts herself by studying their surroundings - the flora of the southern [[Frostlands]] is completely unfamiliar to her.

When they stop at midday for a meal, Shallan asks Tvlakv to set up one of the empty slave wagons as a carriage for her. Wooden sides, typically used as protection for the slaves during [[highstorm|highstorms]], are hooked onto the sides of the cage to provide her some privacy. She also gets the cage's key from Tvlakv, though he seems hesitant to give it to her.

She crawls across the newly enclosed wagon - her feet are injured and standing on them is painful enough to make [[Spren#Painspren|painspren]] appear - and opens the lid to Jasnah's trunk. Pattern, who had been instructed to stay hidden, waits inside. Shallan tells him that the notes need to reach the Shattered Plains, and that she intends to finish Jasnah's work of finding [[Urithiru]] and convincing the [[Alethi]] that the return of the [[Voidbringers]] is imminent. Pattern confirms that the threat from the Voidbringers is real and that they are the reason he was sent to her. As she continues to go through the contents of the trunk, Shallan finds a sketch she had done of Jasnah and is overcome with grief over her mentor's death, as well as the loss of the rest of her sketches. She also laments the loss of the broken [[Soulcasting#Soulcasting_by_the_use_of_a_fabrial|Soulcaster]], which is at the bottom of the ocean, and speculates that the attackers could have been from the same group as [[Kabsal]] and [[Lin Davar|her father]] ([[Ghostbloods|The Ghostbloods]]).

Adolin mentally prepares for his first duel under Dalinar's plan by speaking inspirationally to his Shardblade. He leaves the preparation room and walks to a staging room, where Renarin and Navani are waiting to equip his Shardplate. Navani burns a prayer glyph for safety and glory. Adolin inquires about Jasnah, and Navani replies that her daughter has likely gone missing due to a change of plans, and would reappear at a later time. Renarin verifies that Adolin finished his lucky pre-duel rituals, and Navani scoffs at their superstitions. Adolin tells Renarin that he has suspicions about Kaladin.

Adolin enters the arena to duel Salinor. A large crowd attends as this is the first formal duel at the Shattered Plains for more than a year. Adolin begins in Windstance, but thinks of his father's words and switches to Ironstance and aggressively battles his opponent into submission, winning despite protests from the highjudge BrightLady Istow that Adolin did not follow proper duel protocols. Salinor protests that Adolin cheated and Adolin threatens to choke him until he surrenders his blade, which Salinor then does, and Istow proclaims Adolin as the official victor. Renarin praises Adolin's victory, and Adolin gifts his new weapon to Renarin, who reluctantly accepts it with a frown. Navani praises Adolin for winning without putting his full ability on display in order to deceive future opponents into underestimating him and accepting duels.

Shallan comments about Tvlakv wearing different shoes than on the first day they met, but Tvlakv lies and says he only owns one pair. Shallan asks Pattern to spy on a conversation between Tvlakv and Tag, and Pattern records and replays the chat for Shallan in secret, revealing that Tvlakv intends to protect Shallan, but also to profit from her rescue to try to escape a debt. Shallan uses this information to keep Tvlakv off-balance and to gain the upper hand in their dealings, warning the trader not to play games after Tvlakv expresses doubt over Shallan's story about her betrothal and pending wealth. As she gets up to leave, Tvlakv flinches away from her, and she notices that she is glowing faintly with Stormlight and has a majestic appearance, which she hopes that Tvlakv misinterprets as a trick of the darkness and campfire light. She returns to her wagon and notices that the pain in her infected feet has lessened.

Bluth returns to the camp in a panic, putting out their campfire. Bluth tells them that he spotted a likely caravan of army deserters who may have turned to banditry nearby. They quickly pack up the wagons and travel east to try to escape notice. Bluth explains to Shallan that they probably would not be able to bribe their way past the bandits, since desertion makes them very desperate people.

Kaladin leads a bodyguard patrol, along with Moash and Drehy, through the lighteyes training ground as they scout the area while waiting for Adolin and Renarin. Kaladin converses with an ardent who explains the Alethi tradition of allowing lighteyes to train with royal Shardblades so they are ready if needed in battle.

Moash asks about Kaladin's feelings toward Amaram, and says that the two of them will get their revenge on the lighteyes who have wronged them in the past.

Syl asks Kaladin to tell her what is troubling him, and Kaladin says that Dalinar is tainted by his association with Amaram. After Syl warns Kaladin not to lie, he admits that he thinks Dalinar is honorable and has been deceived by Amaram. Syl advises Kaladin to tell Dalinar how Amaram really got his Shardblade, but Kaladin demurs, thinking that he would not be believed.

On the arrival of Renarin and Adolin, Kaladin reports to them that the area is relatively secure. Adolin confronts Kaladin over his insolence and mentions his suspicions as well, but Kaladin retorts that his place is only to protect Adolin.

Syl tells Kaladin she does not like either Adolin or Renarin, and it is implied this is because they carry Shardblades, though Syl says the blades did not used to be the abominations she now considers them to be.

Kaladin surveys the area and sees someone who appears to be suspicious and goes to investigate. Kaladin speaks with Zahel, an ex-soldier ardent, who is observing Adolin and Renarin train, and who tells Kaladin that he isn't going to harm either of the brothers. Zahel says the two Kholins need to be chosen by a master, and as he speaks, he is summoned by Adolin to join the other gathered ardents. Kaladin asks if Zahel seems odd to Syl, and she replies that all humans seem odd to her except for Rock.

Shallan sits next to Bluth who is guiding their wagon, and distracts herself from worry by talking about plants that she
found. She also draws some sketches of a leaf, the santhid, and Bluth in one of Jasnah's old notebooks, to try to recreate her lost sketch collection. The caravan stops, and Shallan sees smoke on the horizon, which indicates that the deserters are following them and not worried about being seen. Tvlakv says the deserters will give up the chase eventually as long as they keep moving with few stops.

To distract herself further, Shallan chats with the two parshmen but they are unforthcoming. Shallans sketches more plants, then notices a column of smoke along their current path. Tvlakv says that indicates another caravan if they are lucky. They discuss whether to go toward the new group or take a detour east while hoping the deserters run into the second group. Shallan orders Tvlakv to try to intercept the new group and he complies. As she rides along, she draws more sketches, including various sketches of women with Shallan's face. She then moves into the covered wagon to use knobweed sap on her feet and notices they have healed significantly. She asks Pattern if it healed her but it seems ignorant of how to cause or heal injuries to humans. Shallan and Pattern converse about Lightweaving and the Knights Radiant. Shallan asks how to use Stormlight but Pattern doesn't know, so she figures it out on her own and breathes it in, though she is unable to make it do anything. She notices that her wounds heal noticeably however. Pattern reveals that it is a scholar and is excited to learn about humans before it is killed by Shallan, as it believes will eventually happen due to the Knights Radiant somehow killing their spren. Shallan denies that she is a Knight Radiant, but Pattern refutes this by saying that she spoke oaths and is on a possible path to joining one of the Orders.

She leaves the wagon and notices a lot of smoke ahead, and realizes that it is from burning wagons.

Zahel tells Renarin to jump off the roof of the arena to practice being comfortable with his Shardplate. Kaladin criticizes Renarin's clumsiness but Zahel dismisses this and praises Renarin's attitude. Zahel offers to train Kaladin but Kaladin declines. Zahel tests Kaladin's abilities with a blunted Shardblade to make sure he is ready to protect Adolin and Renarin. Zahel defeats Kaladin in a mock duel, though Kaladin did enough simulated damage to slow down the weapons master, and believes he would have given enough protection for Renarin to escape. Adolin makes an insulting comment which enrages Kaladin, and he attacks Adolin. Adolin smashes Kaladin with a plate enhanced punch, and Kaladin is stunned and severely injured as Zahel berates the prince for his carelessness. Kaladin surreptitiously heals himself with Stormlight and tries to attack Adolin again but runs out of strength and collapses. Zahel compliments Kaladin on his tenacity and quick-thinking but says it won't be enough against shardbearers, and says he won't force Kaladin to train. Kaladin asks Syl why he lost strength suddenly and Syl observes that Kaladin was not protecting anyone when it happened.

Shallan is wearing a new silk dress, a gift from her father. The dress is that of a woman as she is now old enough to cover her safehand. She starts to think of her mother, then stops, like a candle suddenly snuffed. Two maids bustle past, getting ready for guests. Shallan overhears one softly whisper "She saw. Poor thing was in the room when it happened. Hasn't spoken a word in five months. The master killed his own wife and her lover." Shallan thinks that because she does not speak, apparently the maids do not think she can hear either. At times, she wonders if she is invisible or not real.

The door suddenly slams open and her brother [[Helaran Davar|Helaran]] enters. Grinning wide, he gives her a gift of charcoal pencils and thick, expensive paper. He has missed her drawings and asks her to practice more. He tells her she needs to be strong and that he needs her to look after the other brothers for him. The door slams open again, this time admitting her father, [[Lin Davar]]. Her father and brother start arguing, and Helaran calls their father a murderer and summons a [[Shardblade]]. Lin cuts off, putting his hands up and says "you don't know what you think you know. Your mother-", but Helaran cuts him off. Shallan manages to say "No" to Helaran, stopping him from killing Lin.

Shallan offers the woman her protection but she laughs and says Shallan can join her caravan to die as they now face two possible enemy groups. Shallan sends Tvlakv to the woman's caravan while she has Bluth drive her with a wagon toward the deserters to confront them. Using Stormlight to weave a disguise to make her appear noble, she speaks to the deserters, asking them for help against the other bandit group and offering amnesty and a fresh start. Vathah, the leader of the deserters, scoffs at her offer but many of his followers are enticed and charge toward the battle to fight the bandits. Shallan then convinces Vathah and the rest to help out. Shallan used all her Stormlight so she stays out of the fighting. Pattern compliments Shallan on her ability to use words to transform people without using soulcasting. Shallan draws a prayer glyph for hope and awaits the outcome of the battle.

Shallan tries to reassure Vathah that she will protect him from prosecution for desertion but he does not believe her, and Pattern tricks Vathah into letting Shallan go.

Tvlakv confronts Shallan with a conspiracy theory about Bluth being a bandit but Shallan disproves it and demands the non-parshmen slaves in compensation for saving his life.

:''Tanatishes 1173''

Kaladin sees a reddish glow through the shutters during a highstorm while in King Elhokar's quarters but it vanishes before he can investigate it. Adolin peruses a catalog while Renarin idly opens and closes a small box. Dalinar and Navani are nearby in a small side-room.
Kaladin studies a ruby heating fabrial which Renarin says was developed by Navani.
Kaladin makes a brusque comment on Adolin's reading material and they argue over whether Kaladin needs to be there to protect them during a highstorm, with Elhokar taking Kaladin's side.
After the storm ends, Dalinar and Navani exit the side-room and Dalinar reports that no mysterious numbers have appeared on the wall. Dalinar talks to Renarin about his visions but stops when he notices Kaladin listening. Dalinar asks Adolin about his progress in setting up more duels and Adolin says that he is only getting refusals now. Dalinar speaks of the situation with Sadeas, and of trying to convince Amaram to secede from Sadeas' princedom, and of Amaram trying to make peace between Kholin and Sadeas. Kaladin states that the shardbearers may be boycotting Adolin's requests to duel and Dalinar agrees and says they have to focus on undermining Sadeas.

Kaladin speaks to Dalinar in private about Amaram's betrayal of Kaladin and about how he actually got his Shardblade. Dalinar asks for proof of the serious accusations and Kaladin mentions witnesses present at the scene. Dalinar tells Kaladin to not speak of the incident and pledges to investigate it, and dresses down Kaladin over his insubordination.

Kaladin and Syl discuss the conversation with Dalinar, and Kaladin states that Dalinar will not do anything and he will take matters into his own hands. Syl replies that Kaladin isn't a Skybreaker and that she worries about him.

Kaladin returns to his barracks and notices a new Herdazian crew member there who is a cousin of Lopen's that abandoned Brightlord Roion's army and allows him to stay. Shen confronts Kaladin over his prohibition on being armed, and says he is being treated like a slave, which upsets Kaladin. One of the guards from the palace, Natam, suddenly appears at the barracks, speaking of an assassin going after the king.

Kaladin returns to the king's quarters to find that everyone is ok and that there is no pending danger. Kaladin and Moash go out to the balcony and find one of the railings torn loose where Elhokar had leaned on it and almost fallen to his death, barely being rescued by a guard. Kaladin finds a joint that had been cut clean through and discusses his findings privately with Dalinar. Kaladin says this was an incompetent or cowardly attempt on the king's life, and that the cut was made by a Shardblade which helps them narrow down the possible suspects. Dalinar says it must be an inside job, and puts Kaladin in charge of guarding Elhokar effective immediately. Kaladin hears Elhokar's complaints about not being protected adequately and thinks the king does not display proper composure, then decides that he should focus on guarding the king and not on judging him.

Shallan listens to Gaz's and Red's stories of how they were recruited into the Alethi army and how they ended up deserting due to the lack of progress on the Vengeance Pact because of the greed of the Highprinces and because of their service oaths binding them to virtual slavery. Vathah derides Gaz for being overly solicitous of Shallan, but Shallan defends Gaz and argues that the deserters have redeemed themselves and insults Vathah to the point that he leaves. Shallan asks about Gaz's debt but he refuses to discuss it and leaves.

Shallan studies Jasnah's notes about the Shattered Plains and Urithiru. Shallan complains to Pattern about how the historians weren't as factual and objective as she would like but Pattern says that truth is subjective. Shallan and Pattern discuss spren and Voidbringers, which disturbs Pattern, and Pattern describes what spren are, mentioning three Shards: Honor, Cultivation and Odium, speaking in a high-pitched tone when mentioning the latter name.

One of Shallan's slaves delivers a summons to visit Tyn, and the two get together to eat dinner. Tyn asks about Shallan's identity and says that she has sent inquiries about Shallan Davar and deduced that her story is so improbable that Shallan is really a con artist and impersonator trying to pull off a scam. Tyn offers to help Shallan with her con and Shallan plays along, implying that she has dangerous secrets about Dalinar.

Dalinar orders Kaladin and Bridge Four to learn how to ride horses so they can travel more quickly around the camp. Moash advises against trusting Dalinar but agrees eagerly to learn to ride for the battlefield advantage that horses give. Jenet, the stablemaster, is displeased but lectures Bridge Four on horsemanship. Adolin appears but is chased off as Jenet tries to hit him with some rocks. After the lecture, Kaladin and the others practice riding the horses, which is difficult for Kaladin at first though he gains a small amount of proficiency. Kaladin questions one of the bridgemen, Natam, about the night that Elhokar almost fell off the balcony. Kaladin realizes the sabotage must have happened after the highstorm. Adolin taunts Kaladin into abandoning his training horse to ride an untamed horse, though Kaladin gives a different reason to Syl, saying it is to get over his fear. Kaladin mounts the new horse, Dreamstorm, using Stormlight to adhere himself to the saddle. The horse tires itself out trying to buck Kaladin from the saddle, and eventually succeeds when the Stormlight runs out. Dalinar orders Kaladin to start patrolling outside the camps using the horses. Kaladin further questions Natam who says that he saw Moash go onto the balcony after the storm but Kaladin dismisses him as a suspect. Kaladin seethes with anger as he sees Dalinar have a friendly chat with Amaram.

Adolin and Jakamav lead an Alethi charge against the Parshendi to capture a gemheart on a pyramid shaped plateau. Jakamav mentions that Adolin isn't supposed to be there and observes that Dalinar is trying to increase cooperation between the highprinces. Adolin and Jakamav reach the chrysalis but they are too late as Eshonai already retrieved the gemheart and gave it to another Parshendi who escaped with it. Eshonai tells Adolin that she wants to parlay with Dalinar. Adolin agrees to tell Dalinar and Eshonai says that a messenger will be sent.

Adolin checks on Renarin and finds out from a guard that Renarin intended to join battle at one of the bridges but had one of his fits after he summoned his Shardblade.

Jakamav comments that Adolin will eventually lose a duel but Adolin complains that he is having difficulty getting anyone to accept a duel. Jakamav reveals that Sadeas has been bribing people to refuse duels but says that Adolin should try challenging Eranniv. Adolin asks to talk about his relationship problems at a winehouse that evening but Jakamav declines, stating that it is not popular to be seen around Adolin due to Dalinar's proclamations.

Adolin stalks off, frustrated, to ride his horse. Renarin tells Adolin that he didn't have a fit when he froze on the battlefield and that it was simply fear. Adolin notices Renarin isn't wearing his glasses. Renarin comments cryptically that they need to be ready for the coming storm.

Shallan is outside in the gardens of their estate sketching. She longs to stay out there, where people do not scream at each other, where there is peace. Unfortunately, it is a fake peace, cultivated like the garden itself. She hears shouts from the nearby manor house, which cause her to tense up and ruin the sketch she's working on. She thinks of her brother [[Helaran]], who brings her the fine sketching paper. His returns home are unpredictable and short, and no one knows where he goes when he leaves. She stares at a blank piece of paper, and loses track of time.

Eventually noticing the sky has darkened, Shallan packs up her things and heads inside. Her father has been throwing feasts regularly, and it is almost time for the one tonight. She turns up the stairs to get ready. There would be a new dress for her to wear as she sits quietly. She suspects her father doesn't like that she has begun speaking again. Perhaps he does not want her to be able to speak of things she has seen. Her mind goes blank.

Her brother [[Jushu]] finds her on the stairs, staring at the wall. Jushu's jacket is undone and askew, and his cheeks are flush with wine. He has no cuff links or belt, having gambled them away. When asked, Jushu tells Shallan that he heard the yelling. [[Balat Davar|Balat]] has been starting fires again, and nearly burned down the servants building. Jushu says that he is the only one left in the family with any sense. They pass their father's quarters. It is being tidied with the door open, which allows Shallan to see the far wall. She stumbles. Though hidden behind a painting, she can see the outline of the strongbox glowing, blazing like fire. Jushu asks what she is staring at, but when she tells him, he thinks she is crazy. Shallan continues to stare at the light, thinking a monster hides there. That her mother's soul hides there.

Tyn speaks with the riders, and proclaims Shallan to be a Horneater Princess, and Shallan attempts to play the role. One of the riders, Kal, inquires if they have seen any bandits and Tyn replies that they had and asks why he cares. Kal replies that they represent the Alethi King and want to patrol the area to clear it of bandits, and presses for more details on the attack. Kal then comments that Shallan looks too thin to be a Horneater, and she acts offended and demands Kal's boots in compensation, which he gives up reluctantly before their patrol departs. Tyn compliments Shallan on her impersonation but criticizes her for being overly empathetic as that is not a good quality in a con artist.

Sadeas rests after a prolonged battle against the parshendi, reveling in the Thrill before the feeling fades away and
contemplating how it grows less sweet as he dwells on the pointlessness of the fights for gemhearts and the lack of progress toward his ultimate goals of conquest. Amaram tells Sadeas that his ploy of carelessness in going on the raid out of turn failed since the correct armies showed up before he left with the gemheart, but Sadeas replies that he doesn't care. Amaram expresses disapproval of Sadeas and says he wants peace with Elhokar and Dalinar, but Sadeas says that he knows how ruthless Amaram really is. Amaram acknowledges this, but says that there is a bigger picture to be concerned with. Amaram asks if Sadeas ever worries about the costs of war, and Sadeas replies that a realistic viewpoint is necessary to achieve anything in life. Hatham confronts Sadeas, who concedes the gemheart and proclaims that he was bored, and then leaves to return to the warcamp.

Sadeas sits at the dueling arena, contemplating that his fashionable clothes are very uncomfortable and wishing that he could wear a simple uniform like Dalinar's if that didn't send the wrong message. Sadeas thinks about aging and desire to achieve a form of immortality through conquest. Ialai shows up and praises Sadeas' stratagem of giving away the gemheart to undermine Dalinar's accusations of greed. Sadeas says he is not pleased that Eranniv accepted the duel despite his efforts to block Adolin from having any dueling opponents, and that he wants Dalinar's plan to fail so that he can rebuild their kingdom to his own specifications. As Adolin duels with Eranniv, Ialai described the failed assassination attempt on Elhokar, and they debate the ramifications of it, as Sadeas ponders that Elhokar must die and Dalinar must be dealt with so that he can wipe the slate clean. Sadeas and Ialai decide to expose Dalinar as a hypocrite since he didn't involve Sadeas in the assassination investigation which would be only proper as Sadeas is the Highprince of Information. Sadeas says he will renounce his post in protest when it will cause the most harm to Dalinar's strategy. Sadeas realizes that Adolin is toying with his opponent and that he is very skilled and clever to win while appearing to be losing. Sadeas tells Ialai to stop from interfering with Adolin's dueling aspirations to try to take advantage of Adolin's hotheadedness, and to invite Ruthar on his next hunt.

Shallan settles down to draw sketches of the small garden and is joined by Gaz, who requests that she draw a sketch of him, to which she replies that she will. Shallan draws a quick portrait with slight modifications from reality to make Gaz appear more impressive and Gaz is very appreciative. Vathah tells Shallan they are stopping for the night and Pattern tells Shallan there will be trouble, and Shallan agrees. Shallan draws a bunch of sketches of the thicket, then draws whatever floats into her mind, including a rocky ocean shore with some indistinct figures of which one reminds her of Yalb and a woman taking a hammer and chisel to a statue, though Shallan does not know why she drew the last picture.

Tyn tells Shallan she has artistic talent but should practice forgery instead of drawing, and that she wants to introduce Shallan to some friends in the Shattered Plains. She also claims Shallan needs a dose of realism in order to be ready for the real life of a criminal. Tyn asks if Shallan wants to back out of their criminal enterprise, but Shallan says she is committed and that her planned scam is to impersonate the betrothed of Adolin Kholin. Tyn gives Shallan some advice on carrying out her love scam. As they talk, Shallan worries about the state of the betrothal even though it is secondary to her research on Urithiru and the Voidbringers, and about what to do with Tyn when the fake scam falls through, though she is also excited as well.

Kaladin falls asleep during the highstorm and dreams he is the storm and speaks to the Stormfather about Syl. The Stormfather says that Kaladin will betray and kill Syl and that he is already beginning to do so. As they speak, a second larger storm with red lightning appears and the Stormfather says he is sorry, and tells Kaladin that “He comes”. Kaladin wakes up as Adolin and Renarin are discussing the upcoming meeting with the Parshendi envoy. Kaladin goes to the balcony to check on the weather but only sees the diminishing of the winds as the highstorm passes.

Pattern whimpers during the highstorm and ignores Shallan as the highstorm passes over.

Syl tells Kaladin something is wrong and that the One who Hates is coming, and that something bad is going to happen. Heeding Syl's warning, he goes into Dalinar's and Navani's small room to tell them they need to take the king and leave the palace and head into the warcamp. Kaladin explains that his instincts sense danger and Dalinar agrees to trust his senses and leave the palace despite Elhokar's dissent. Kaladin sends Beld and Hobber to scout their way out and leaves Moash and Ralinor to guard their rear while Mart and Eth stay with the king. As they flee through the palace, they find a dark hallway where the spheres were drained of light and a hole cut into the palace through the rock wall. Szeth appears, Stormlight leaking from his body.

Dalinar orders Renarin to take the king and flee. Dalinar, Adolin and Kaladin stay to fight Szeth, Dalinar and Kaladin armed with spears and Adolin with his Shardblade. The three rush Szeth but he eludes them using a Lashing, then binds Adolin to the ceiling. Kaladin and Dalinar both stab Szeth with their spears, but he chops the weapons in half with his blade and smacks down Dalinar as he heals using Stormlight. Adolin falls to the ground when the Lashing runs out, and he stays down. Kaladin uses his spear like a quarterstaff and with Syl flying around him attacks Szeth, hitting him a few times and forcing him to draw in more Stormlight. Szeth is able to dodge a strike and stab Kaladin through his arm with the Shardblade, causing it to go numb and lifeless, and Kaladin then is kicked into a wall, and slumps in frustration as Szeth goes to chase down his prey.

Syl tells Kaladin that Szeth is not a radiant but something worse and pleads for Kaladin to get up. Dalinar confronts Szeth and says he won't let the king die but Szeth says he is there to kill Dalinar instead. As Szeth swings it from above his head at him for a killing blow, Dalinar catches the Shardblade between his palms, and Kaladin arrives and knocks both himself and Szeth through the hole in the wall into open air.

As Szeth and Kaladin plunge toward the ground, Szeth starts glowing more brightly and Kaladin uses Szeth's gemstones to draw in some Stormlight before he loses his grip on the assassin. Kaladin lands hard but the Stormlight quickly heals him, though his right arm is still grey and lifeless although he has some slight sense of feeling in his arm. Szeth is shocked at Kaladin's survival and thinks that he accidentally lashed Kaladin to slow his fall. As Szeth pauses in confusion, Kaladin uses his Stormlight to bring his right arm back to life, and Szeth cries out in surprise. Szeth jumps back in shock and asks what Kaladin is and Kaladin replies that he is a windrunner, the same as Szeth. But Szeth denies this, angrily shouting that he was named Truthless, and asks if the Radiants are all back. Kaladin says yes and Szeth flees. Kaladin collapses in exhaustion.

Kaladin wakes up with Syl hovering nearby and expresses surprise at his ability to heal the Shardblade wound, which Syl did not expect either. Syl tells him there are dead at the battle scene and goes with Kaladin back inside the palace. Kaladin tracks down the king's entourage. Dalinar is shocked at Kaladin's survival and Kaladin says that he held onto Szeth as they fell and somehow lived due to Szeth's abilities, which the others believe. Kaladin wants to tell Dalinar about his abilities but not Adolin or Elhokar so he says nothing. Kaladin says that Szeth escaped and that he saw a light in the darkness which earns a glance from Syl though it wasn't a complete lie. Elhokar says that Szeth came for him and no one corrects him on his mistake. Kaladin leaves to do something and tells the others to stay there.

Adolin ponders the strangeness of Kaladin apparently healing from a Shardblade wound and surviving a great fall but dismisses his suspicions as paranoia. Elhokar goes to get more wine and they find a series of glyphs carved into the wood and Renarin says that in thirty-eight days, it will be the end of all nations.

Kaladin finds Beld's corpse and laments that he failed the bridgeman, but Syl says that he died protecting and that was Beld's choice. Kaladin asks about how skilled the assassin was and if Kaladin has more words to speak, but Syl says that though there are more words, he is not ready yet to speak them.  Kaladin asks how the assassin could have found a spren to bond and yet still slaughter without honor and compares that to his killing of Parshendi, and Syl says the two situations are totally different since Kaladin is protecting, and that Szeth's Shardblade is somehow different and that he uses the wrong amount of Stormlight.

Kaladin finds Hobber still alive, but with both legs disabled, and says he will stay with Bridge Four as a cook, and brings him back to get medical attention.

Shallan is angered that Tyn wants to turn them in and says that she promised them amnesty but Tyn scoffs at this and says that a con artist can't afford to believe their own lies and that Shallan has no chance to get Sadeas to forgive the deserters. Shallan is upset at this and worries that she will soon get caught up between the truth and Tyn's misguided notions over who Shallan really is. Tyn continues reading the spanreed and gleefully announces that there is good news and Shallan reads the printout about Jasnah being dead and the Wind's Pleasure being lost with all hands. Tyn confirms that this was her job to the south.

The spanreed also mentions about Jasnah taking a new ward, a girl named Shallan. Tyn reacts immediately, slamming Shallan to the ground and asking if Jasnah somehow survived. Shallan says no. Pattern distracts Tyn briefly but it is not enough for Shallan to break free. Tyn draws her sword to kill Shallan, but Shallan uses Stormlight to create an illusion to distract Tyn long enough for her to summon her Shardblade and kill her.

Vathah, Gaz and the other deserters appear at the tent, saying they heard a voice telling them to help Shallan, then heard Shallan's screams and fought their way through Tyn's soldiers to help Shallan. Vathah sees the Shardblade and says that Shallan could have killed all the bandits on her own. Shallan tells them the voice they heard was her spren, Tyn was an assassin, and they are to search Tyn's tent for any documents for Shallan to read. Shallan watches as the spanreed continues to write that Tyn's employers, who happen to be the Ghostbloods, want to hire her for another job and inquires if she would like to have a meeting arranged in the warcamps. Shallan realizes that the city the Ghostbloods are investigating is Urithiru, and replies yes.

As a highstorm approaches the city of Narak, Thude reports to Eshonai that they have a meeting in seven days with the Alethi and that he didn't see either Dalinar or the Surgebinder when he arranged the meeting. Eshonai attunes Resolve and brings her captive spren into the highstorm to transform. Eshonai stands in the storm, with a shield braced against a rock to protect her from the winds, to face the Stormfather head on rather than sheltering in rocks. The wind blows her shield away leaving her exposed, though she is able to hold onto some rocks to keep from being blown away. The eye of the storm reaches her and the Stormfather asks if this is really what she wants. The red spren breaks free from its crystal and shoots out red lightning. Eshonai has a bad premonition and says no and tries to elude the spren, but it hits her in the chest shooting out red tendrils. The Stormfather says that this was inevitable, he cannot protect Eshonai, and he is sorry. Eshonai begins to transform.

Bordin speaks to Elhokar and Dalinar of his journey with Wit to transport a seeming madman to the Shattered Plains, as the madman listens on and thinks of various torments that he has undergone. The madman identifies himself as Talenel'Elin, Herald of War, and speaks of the desolations wiping out past knowledge and of the other Heralds helping to prepare the world for the Time of the Return and Desolation, though his audience can barely understand him since he is speaking inaudibly with a northern Alethi accent. Bordin says the madman just dropped his Shardblade and that his eyes were always dark. Bordin suggests sending the madman to the ardents to take care of him. The madman comments that the coming days will be difficult but humanity will survive, and that he must be brought to their leaders. Dalinar says he has a use for the Shardblade and needs Bordin's assistance as well. The madman comments that he thinks he is late this time and asks himself how long had it been.

She is able to leap a chasm by crouching and throwing herself into the air, with less effort than warform required. Thude confronts her, saying her eyes are red which is something referenced in the songs but Eshonai cuts him off. Venli approaches, and is told that with the Stormform that she can move in the highstorm unimpeded and that she can feel a storm building beyond the rhythms, a highstorm that they can guide to use against their enemies. Eshonai addresses the crowd, saying that she saw the betrayal in the Storm Rider's eyes, and that he intends to help humans against the Parshendi, but that they can now fight back using this new form, and the crowd hums to Awe in appreciation.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishaches 1173''

Adolin paces about on a plateau, wearing his Shardplate, dwelling on the assassination attempt the prior evening. Adolin tries to practice throwing his Shardblade but loses focus often since he did not get any sleep because he was guarding his father's quarters throughout the night. Adolin thinks that his three bridgemen guards are useless, but reflects that Kaladin was unusually effective in protecting Dalinar, though he is also very unlikable and strange. Adolin succeeds in throwing his Shardblade, and returns to the warcamp with his bodyguards, and notices a procession of Soulcasters that usually aren't seen during daytime. Adolin converses with the main ardent Soulcaster Kadash and learns that their services are in high demand and that they have to increase their training and work shifts. Adolin watches as a group of Soulcasters working behind a silk screen for concealment use their fabrials in concert to create a stone windbreak. Adolin questions Kadash about the old Radiants and Kadash answers noncommittally at first until Adolin expresses that he needs information urgently due to the fact that the assassin had Radiant-like abilities and Kadash then agrees to do research for Adolin.

Navani stands on an observation platform in the engineering grounds and supervises an experiment to use a fabrial to cause a platform to be raised into the air. After extensive preparations and careful implementation, their attempt to cause a round wooden parapet to float in the air without support succeeds. Adolin joins Navani and they talk in private, with Navani explaining in technical terms how she arranged fabrials in tandem to act like levers to produce the desired results. Adolin realizes the military application for this, but Navani says there are more practical applications than raising archers in a battlefield. Adolin confronts Navani over her relationship with Dalinar and the awkward position that his father is in regarding violating social customs that he lectures other highprinces about following, but she scoffs at those traditions, and tells Adolin that he is free of his betrothal for the time being due to Jasnah's disappearance. Adolin and Navani leave for a meeting with Dalinar and Elhokar.

Pattern opens a lock on one of Tyn's trunks for Shallan and she examines the contents, finding clothing and spheres among other useful items.

Vathah reports to Shallan that he has burned all the bodies of Tyn and her guards, and she says that she will deal with the skeletons to avoid uncomfortable questions. Macob sends a servant to retrieve a palanquin for Shallan, then goes his own way.

As Shallan enters the warcamp, accompanied by Vathah and his deserter guards, and her slaves, she frets over her betrothal and plans to continue Jasnah's research. She learns that Dalinar is in conference with Elhokar, and orders her palanquin to be brought to the meeting. As she travels to the palace, she draws a sketch of herself confidently confronting Dalinar to try to boost her own morale. At the palace, Shallan enters with Vathah and Gaz as attendants. They reach the conference room at the top of the palace, and Kaladin spots her, and asks her if Adolin is betrothed to a Horneater princess and she replies that she was trying to travel incognito. Kaladin has Gaz seized, and says that Shallan is an impostor since Adolin's real betrothed was lost at sea, but Shallan gives a spanreed printout to Kaladin to have Navani authenticate her claims. Shallan becomes upset at Kaladin's lack of accommodation and they have a heated argument. Kaladin stalks away angry, but Shallan feels that the disturbance will lead to the desired result of her receiving an audience with Dalinar. Gaz mentions that Kaladin was a slave in the lumberyards recently and is very dangerous.

Kaladin enters the chamber with the paper, and returns after a short time, summoning Shallan to enter.

:''Ishaches 1173''

During a break two hours after the meeting started, Adolin ponders on the lack of consensus on how to deal with the threat that Szeth poses to the kingdom and how dangerous he is even with the number of shardbearers that are available to protect Elhokar and Dalinar, based on the reports of Szeth's other attacks. Adolin drinks some wine and taunts Relis over his boasts about wanting to duel Szeth to try to bait him into a duel. Adolin then directly challenges Relis but Relis says that Adolin has to rise in the rankings according to protocol before he can fight him. Relis declines despite Adolin offering to wager five shards against one, but Elit accepts a duel for the same proceeds. Relis is upset that Elit accepted the duel and tries to taunt Adolin to a violent comeback and possible voiding of the duel agreement but Adolin restrains himself. Sadeas taunts Adolin more effectively, causing Adolin to come near to punching him before he is restrained by Amaram who counsels him to ignore Sadeas. Adolin tells Amaram to abandon Sadeas for Dalinar but he refuses and says that he is able to keep the kingdom from falling apart further by bridging the gap between Sadeas and Dalinar. Adolin's mind wanders as Amaram speaks about how Sadeas' and Dalinar's goals are the same despite the different means they use, and he sees Shallan and is drawn to her immediately. Amaram comments on his flightiness and need to settle down and comments that the girl is probably from Jah Keved, and Adolin realizes who she is and goes over to meet her, as she speaks with Dalinar and Navani about Jasnah being lost at sea.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishaches 1173''

Shallan offers her condolences on Jasnah's loss to Dalinar and Navani, reflecting on her own grief but using her sketch to project strength and suppress her emotions, and Dalinar thanks her. Shallan mentions that she also brought some of Jasnah's belongings and has information on Jasnah's research, which Navani scoffs at. Shallan notices Adolin looking at her and feels some attraction toward him. Shallan gives a detailed account of the attack on the Wind's Pleasure at Navani's demand, and Navani berates Shallan for saying she set the ship on fire despite Jasnah's apparently already fatal wound but Dalinar defends Shallan's action and Navani apologizes and leaves. Shallan tells Dalinar an abbreviated version of her journey via caravan from the Frostlands to the warcamps and about being rescued by deserters to whom she pledged clemency in reward for their service, and Dalinar promises pardons from the king for them. Shallan then brings up the betrothal and Adolin joins them, smiling. Shallan and Adolin flirt awkwardly and Adolin offers to maintain the betrothal, but Dalinar asks Adolin to get some wine so he can talk privately with Shallan. Dalinar inquires about Shallan's family and her interest in Adolin, and she explains the situation as Jasnah described it to her. Dalinar allows the betrothal to stand temporarily based on Jasnah's implied endorsement of Shallan pending further developments, and offers her a position as a clerk. Their discussion is abruptly interrupted by Highprince Sebarial who gets Dalinar to return to the conference table to resume the meeting.

Shallan mentally notes the attendees of the meeting, realizing that there are three primary factions with Elhokar and Dalinar opposing Sadeas, Ruthar and Aladar, and Hatham leading a group of mediators, and Sebarial as an outsider excluded from the factions. Shallan dissects the meaning behind the arguments until she is drawn into the discussion. Shallan says that she has little knowledge about the events in Jah Keved since she wasn't there at the time of the assassination and that she is there as Jasnah's ward and has personal business, and Aladar realizes she is Adolin's betrothed. Several highprinces want to get her own testimony about events in her home country but she doesn't want to be used, so she lies and says that she took a job to work for her supposed distant relative Sebarial and he plays along with her ploy. Shallan speaks privately with Sebarial, saying that their arrangement will be mutually beneficial. Dalinar disrupts the discussion and says that the war is failing and that they will change their strategy to either make peace with the Parshendi or march in full force and wipe them out. Hatham expresses disdain and Sadeas insults Dalinar, which upsets and provokes Adolin momentarily. Dalinar mentions the Parshendi envoy who offered an olive branch right before the assassination attempt and wonders at the coincidence and if the Parshendi are still controlling Szeth as they claimed to have when Gavilar was killed. Dalinar outlines his plans to scout the plains and outfit a major expedition to the center of the plains and choose and train new Shardbearers to use the armor and weapons that he thinks Adolin will win through duels, then brings the meeting to a close.

Sebarial leaves and Shallan says she will meet him, and goes to speak to Elhokar personally about his sister. She then brings a writ of pardon to Vathah, which amazes him, and tells him that they all have a place to stay.

Calmly, Redin stands up and announces that any lighteyes of high birth can provide witness, and asks if any of the children will come with him to do so. Balat grabs the sides of his chair as if to stand, but seeing Lin's face stops and whispers that his father will kill him. Shamespren stir among the children, then Redin states that if any of them remember something they want to tell, they will find willing ears.

Kaladin gives orders for Teft to train bridge seventeen in the chasms. There are thirty-seven days remaining before the mysterious glyph countdown reaches zero. Syl asks Kaladin what his goal is now that his bridgemen are relatively safe. Kaladin says he wants to beat Szeth but Syl scoffs at Kaladin's explanation that he is trying to protect Dalinar. Kaladin encounters Sigzil who is speculating with Rock and Lopen about Szeth's motivations and true employer as he was trained by his master to ask questions. Kaladin tries to duplicate Szeth's feat of walking on walls but fails. Sigzil wishes he could see Syl and she appears to him. Kaladin asks both Syl and Sigzil about Windrunners so he can be better
prepared to battle Szeth but neither is able to give any information. Sigzil, Rock and Lopen discuss the attempt to make Elhokar fall off his balcony but Kaladin ignores them and suddenly has an insight and a vision of another world that allows him to walk on the wall of the chasm.

Kaladin tells Syl that he protects Dalinar so that he can know if Dalinar lives up this reputation as being honorable, and Syl says that honor lives in people and spren like her. Kaladin says that if he trusts Dalinar, he will share the knowledge of his abilities with him. Kaladin says that he will kill Amaram for his betrayal. Kaladin falls from the chasm wall and lands in the chasm with Stormlight aided strength. Kaladin explains his theory about the shardbearer slicing the balcony after the highstorm. Kaladin notices gouges from where a chasmfiend passed and is concerned that it will be dangerous to train here.

Kaladin and the others return to their barracks and find a tense dinner gathering. Renarin asks to join bridge four to become a warrior like Dalinar and Adolin and to be glorified in the Tranquiline Halls. Renarin eventually persuades Kaladin to allow him to provisionally join Bridge Four as a new recruit, and shows a good attitude even when given menial tasks to do. Moash expresses doubt but Kaladin says that Renarin is different from most lighteyes and could fit in with them. Kaladin ponders how to confront Moash over suspicion of him helping to assassinate Elhokar. Moash advises Kaladin to try to get a duel against Amaram to deliver his own justice. Moash and a few bridgemen leave to go drinking and invite Kaladin but he declines and stays to eat dinner.

Shallan receives a message on the spanreed that indicates the Ghostbloods want to meet with Tyn that evening, but Shallan says that she is not well and that she will send an apprentice in her (Tyn's) place.

One of the people reminds her of Hoid. The man points a blow gun past her and shoots a dart at a target behind her.

The man praises Shallan's boldness and tries to bribe Shallan into revealing where Tyn is hiding, but Shallan declines, and calls his bluff of torturing her successfully. The man says he revised his plan to kill Shallan and track down Tyn, and that he is satisfied at Tyn's partial success but unhappy that Tyn didn't show up in person. Five other people including a masked woman are present. Shallan takes a moment to examine the shelves of mementos. The man, who identifies himself as Mraize, says his next target is Amaram. Mraize says that Tyn is to learn Amaram's secrets from his manor and bring information the following week. Shallan aka Veil accepts the assignment and doesn't haggle over the payment and is dismissed.

After Shallan leaves the building, Pattern warns her that the masked woman is tailing her. She draws a sketch and creates an illusionary wall to hide from her pursuer. Shallan's disguise vanishes as her Stormlight runs out and she ditches her coat and hat and returns to the manor, feeling excited over her adventure. Shallan makes plans to investigate Amaram and interact with Adolin.

;Plot Summary

Kaladin arrives at the lighteyes training grounds and asks Zahel to train him and Moash, Teft and Yake. Zahel plays a game where he throws rocks into a circle and tells Kaladin to do laps around the grounds, but then tells him to stay as it was only a test. Zahel gives instruction to Renarin, then brings one of the king's Shardblades for the bridgemen to practice with. Zahel tells them he got permission from Dalinar and Elhokar for them to learn sword stances to better counter Szeth's attacks. Zahel says there is nothing holy about the sword and that he is not a very good ardent. Moash, Teft and Yake practice with the Shardblade but Kaladin declines since he has bad memories of friends being killed by them. Kaladin tells Zahel to swing the blade at him without a guard so that he can have practice facing one. Syl thanks Kaladin for not using the blade. As Kaladin is dodging Zahel's swings, he meets Adolin who gives him a nod of respect. Ivis takes Zahel's place and trains the bridgemen on the ten Shardblade stances. After the practice, Kaladin gets some water and glances around the training grounds, and spots Shallan. Yake says she is good looking but Kaladin retorts that she is lighteyed. Teft says they should keep an eye on Shallan as a possible assassin and Kaladin agrees. Kaladin goes to talk to Shallan and Adolin joins him, saying she is probably there to ogle him and that she can't stay as it would set a bad precedent. Shallan goes to speak to Nall and doesn't even notice Adolin. Shallan asks permission to sketch the Shardplate and Shardblades for the royal record and receives it from Nall. Adolin says he thinks Shallan is there to watch him, but Shallan says that Adolin is egotistic for thinking that, and she tells Kaladin she returned his boots slightly modified, and that she still wants to take a walk with Adolin. Shallan abruptly leaves them to watch Renarin and Zahel, and Adolin grins and says that Shallan is insufferable for ignoring him and he then walks away. Kaladin rejoins Moash and the others but watches Adolin, Renarin and Shallan. Moash says that Elhokar had his family executed and explains how it happened and that another lighteyes was also involved. Kaladin asks if Moash cut the balcony railing and Moash says they can't speak there since it is too open. Moash doesn't deny it and Kaladin grows agitated and threatens to turn Moash in but is convinced not to as long as Moash stops trying to kill the king. Moash says others are involved and asks Kaladin to meet them and he agrees to. Syl says they should go to Dalinar and that she senses danger but Kaladin says that he wants to find out more first.

Kaladin practices with the Shardblade and ignores laughter and frowns from some lighteyes, thinking he was actually worthy for defeating that shardbearer, and on how Alethi society is hypocritical on its treatment of darkeyes. Kaladin asks Syl for advice on who is right to kill and who isn't and Syl says it depends if he is killing to protect or not. Kaladin asks to learn the lastclap maneuver, which Dalinar used to catch Szeth's Shardblade, from Zahel but he says it won't be useful to learn, and the swordmaster is happy that Kaladin accepts his explanation.

;Plot Summary
:''Three and a half years ago''
Shallan and her family are attending the [[Middlefest]] Fair on her father's estates, which draws people from hamlets and villages all around. A Thaylen merchant has a colorful show [[chicken]], [[Jeksonofnone]], on display, and Shallan thinks it bizarre. She follows her father to their box at the dueling arena, where they are soon approached by Brightlord [[Revilar]]. Revilar tries to force her father into an unfavorable business deal, noting his popularity with [[Valam|Highprince Valam]] and House Davar's declining status. Eventually her father bows his head and they send Shallan away.

She is excited to see the fair unchaperoned but forces herself to do work first. After finding [[Eylita Tavinar]], who gives her a note, she sets off to find brother [[Balat]]. While searching she thinks of her mother and her mind goes blank. [[Jix]], one of her house's guards, eventually finds her and agrees to accompany her. Balat is at the [[Axehound]] fights in the gambling pavilion, watching intensely, fixated on the animals killing each other. Shallan gives him the note, and he's surprised and excited by the meeting she's arranged. After he leaves, Shallan sits on a rock, relieved to be out of the pavilion and happy she was able to help Balat, even in a small way.

When she returns to her father's box, he's in a meeting with a man she doesn't recognize. The man, dressed in black, seems startled when he sees Shallan and almost drops his glass. Malise tells her that the man claims to have brought word from her brother Helaran. When asked what news the man brought, her father commands her not to speak Helaran's name and declares him disinherited.

Shallan leaves and seeks out their carriage. [[Wikim]] is within, depressed and despondent. He asks whether their father sent her, or whether she came on "one of her new little missions of mercy". He tells her that she can't fix their family, and that he won't be around to see their collapse because he'll be dead by then. Feeling like a fool, she gives him the gift she had prepared, a set of math problems, then hastens away from the carriage fighting back tears.

Sitting on a rock and trying to compose herself, the messenger in black starts talking with her. The man, unbeknownst to Shallan, is [[Wit]]. He tells her that the message sent by Helaran to her father is that he "has eyes nearby, and is watching." Wit then asks her if spren talk to her, which causes her to think about "twisted symbols the eye should not see" and "her mother's soul in a box". She tells him that of course they don't and that she should be returning to her father. Wit tells Shallan that Helaran was right, her father is destroying their family, but wrong about everything else. He points out that Wikim is engrossed in the math problems that she had given him. He asks her to tell him the most beautiful thing she can imagine, and she describes a scene with her family happily living together. As she talks, Wit pulls out some spheres and wisps of Stormlight hang in the air between them. When she notices, she draws back and the light fades. Wit tells her that she will need to understand the nature of lies and see truth before she can expand upon it.

:''Ishachah 1173''

Kaladin reviews bridge seventeen and tells Pitt how impressed he is, which is a lie but spoken to motivate. He then checks on bridge eighteen where there are problems with cohesion. Kaladin gives them a motivational speech and decides to split them up if their morale doesn't improve. As Kaladin goes to check on bridge nineteen, Sylphrena chides him on working instead of eating dinner. She tells Kaladin that she sees red spren sometimes and Kaladin thinks there is a connection to the countdown which points to the Weeping. Kaladin relents and goes to his barracks for dinner stew. Kaladin scoffs in disbelief that more of Lopen's cousin's joined bridge four. Kaladin finds Shen and gives him a spear and tells him that he will be permitted to train and Shen praises Kaladin, and starts to tell him something else but is interrupted by Moash, who tells Kaladin to join them going out. As they walk through the warcamp, they hear rumors of war in Jah Keved and a new emperor in Azir, and Sigzil pays the crier for more information. Moash picks a tavern called the Ornery Chull for them to visit, and Peet concurs. The bridgemen order drinks and Rock speaks of his homeland and how the Horneaters ended up living in the mountains with the help of the gods. Rock says the hot springs are not just regular water, but rather a connection to the gods and a place to view the place of the gods. Rock tells the bridgemen that there are certain details that he cannot divulge since they are complicated, such as the reason why he can see spren, and also tells them to stop making incorrect assumptions about the story. Rock says he met a god named Lunu'anaki from the hot springs who cannot hurt people, and Sigzil is startled by his physical description. The conversation turns to how Sadeas has not been obeying the hunt rotations, causing people to talk in the warcamps. Kaladin fantasizes about bringing Sadeas down using his abilities.

Moash tells Kaladin that the people he wants Kal to meet have arrived, and the two leave to see them in a private dining room with four people inside and a couple of guards. A man named Graves greets Kaladin heartily, and Kaladin recognizes Danlan also. Kaladin calls the so-called patriots out on their plans to kill Elhokar, and Graves defends their goal as protecting the kingdom from a terrible ruler and getting a replacement in Dalinar. Kaladin argues against their plans, but eventually says he will consider helping them, and leaves with Moash. Kaladin tells Moash he wants nothing to do with the plot and that Moash is just pursuing his grudge and not acting out of patriotism, and that Moash is not to meet with them anymore.

;Plot Summary
:''Three years ago''
Shallan, Balat and Wikim are relaxing in the gardens when they hear a carriage arriving at their house. Balat goes to see who it is, and Wikim tells Shallan that what she's been doing has been helping their family. He gives her a bag of dried [[blackbane]] that he's been carrying for over a year, indicating that he no longer wants to kill himself, then jogs off to the house. Though unsettled by the blackbane, she returns to her drawing.

A short time later she is interrupted by shouting. When she reaches the house, she finds three men standing before her father and Jushu kneeling on the floor with his hands tied behind his back. Lin says he won't pay Jushu's gambling debts, despite his son's pleas, and tells the men that they can have him. Shallan begs Ballat to do something as Jushu is dragged away, but he doesn't know what he can do.

Shallan follows her father into his study. The house's ledgers are open and she can see that they are in staggering debt. Her father tells her that he doesn't have the spheres to pay the men, and commands her confined to her rooms.

Crying, she runs back into the feast hall, asks Balat and Wikim for the daggers their father had given them, then chases after Jushu and the men. She manages to convince the men to take the daggers and her necklace (which they decide not to keep) in payment of Jushu's debt, though they are only worth about half of it. She tells Jushu, who's been beaten and can't hear well, that Balat and Wikim saved him.

She returns to her rooms and waits, hearing the inevitable shouts. Eventually her father opens the door to her room. She can see the crumpled form of [[Minara]], their serving maid, in the hall. Her arm is broken and she leaves a streak of blood on the wall as she tries to crawl away. Her father tells Shallan that he's found a way to control himself, he just needs to let his anger out, and that his anger is created when people disobey him. He tells her that he would never hurt her, and so he wouldn't want to have to punish others because she defied him again.

Shallan arrives at an open-air winehouse to meet Adolin for lunch. Shallan tries to focus on her purpose of allying with House Kholin but is distracted by romantic considerations. Shallan and Adolin make small talk until Shallan is alarmed when Adolin says that a highstorm is expected soon and she considers how exposed their lunch table is. Adolin explains that there is a new trend to stay outside during the approach of highstorms and wait until the last minute to seek shelter. Shallan asks Adolin to talk about his experiences with plateau runs to show interest in him but ends up derailing the conversation by asking an inappropriate question which ends up impressing Adolin and making him more open.

Shallan then asks about the chasmfiends and draws some sketches of chrysalises from memory as Adolin answers and points to one of the drawings to indicate what chasmfiends look like. Shallan theorizes that the hunts are culling the chasmfiend population and that a study should be made to verify this, and that she would like to be involved in that, and that she wants to go on a hunt to gather first-hand information. Adolin tells Shallan about the upcoming summit with the Parshendi and the political situation in the warcamps and Dalinar's visions and plans. In turn, Shallan confides in Adolin about Jasnah's research and about how the parshmen are related to the Voidbringers and asks if the parshmen could be removed from the warcamps but Adolin doesn't think that is possible. As the highstorm arrives, the winehouse area is vacated for the shelters, but Shallan stays transfixed as she watches the storm approach, despite Adolin's attempts to get her to go indoors. She has a sudden desire to sketch, but Adolin drags her inside before the doors are closed. Adolin says that he will try to get her permission to go on a hunt before they split up into separate rooms divided by gender. Shallan feels satisfied at her progress despite her unorthodox methods and ignores jealous looks from women as she plans how to sneak into Amaram's house.

:''Isheves 1173''

Adolin sits in the storm shelter listening to the highstorm. Adolin chats with Elit who vows to win their upcoming Shard duel. Sadeas sits next to Adolin and makes him uncomfortable. Sadeas flaunts some emeralds that he obtained from an unauthorized hunt, and taunts Adolin about the bridgemen and his renouncing of his title of [[Highprince of Information]]. Sadeas says he is trying to save their kingdom from Elhokar and Dalinar and that Adolin will make a good Highprince and Adolin replies in anger, threatening Sadeas, who then walks away.

After the highstorm ends, Adolin along with two bridgemen guards leaves the market, putting Sadeas out of his mind to think about how much he likes Shallan. Adolin spends some time shopping for jewelry for Shallan before returning to his complex. Adolin finds some bridgemen outside Dalinar's sitting room, and glyphs on the wall that say thirty-two days, seek the center. Adolin calls for the area to be restricted and for Navani to be summoned.

Dalinar determines the glyphs were inscribed with his knife and Navani says that they were probably etched by Dalinar himself. Adolin says he is worried because Dalinar is foretelling which is something of the Voidbringers supposedly. They discuss the meaning and decide that they will follow the advice to seek the center of the Shattered Plains in thirty-two days during the Weeping, which they think will be easier if their peace summit with the Parshendi is successful. They cover up the glyphs and swear the guards to secrecy. Adolin asks about the parshman bridgeman being armed and Dalinar said he allowed it out of curiosity.

Adolin joins a planning meeting with Dalinar, Navani, Khal, Teshav and Kaladin to discuss tactics for the upcoming summit with the Parshendi. Adolin decides to attend the summit in Dalinar's place to keep his father out of harm's way.

Adolin rides Dalinar's Ryshadium, Gallant, to keep up pretenses, as he travels to the meeting with the Parshendi. After Adolin arrives at the designated plateau, the Parshendi arrive as well. Adolin and his scribe Brightness Inadara meet alone with Eshonai. Adolin says they are there to discuss terms of a Parshendi surrender, but Eshonai laughs and says things changed since she spoke with Adolin previously. Adolin senses a different demeanor to Eshonai, who says there will be peace only when one of the sides is wiped out, and that she only appeared to see Dalinar in person. Adolin asks why they killed Gavilar and she replies because he revealed his plans to return the Parshendi gods, then she leaves. Adolin returns to the warcamps with his entourage.

Adolin broods that he should have allowed Dalinar to go instead, but Dalinar replies that Adolin did well and that now they can battle the Parshendi with a clear conscience. Dalinar reveals a battleplan to take as many soldiers and highprinces as possible to the center of the Shattered Plains during the Weeping to bring an end to the war. Dalinar implores Adolin to fight more duels and says he will try to convince neutral highprinces to join the expedition.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishevan 1173''

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin walks through the Shattered Plains at night to the plateau where he encountered Wit a few weeks previously. Kaladin verifies that no one can see him, and he steps off the plateau into a chasm.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan walks through Sadeas' warcamp disguised as a messenger boy. Shallan enters Amaram's manor after passing a checkpoint guarded by Hav.

Shallan waits for a maid and a man to leave the manor grounds, then changes her clothing and disguise to impersonate her, and enters the manor.

'''Kaladin'''

After landing at the bottom, he runs through the chasm, with Sylphrena alongside him. He tries to jump onto a wall but fails and lands on the ground. Sylphrena offers some advice, and Kaladin agrees that he has to practice to be able to fight and Lash as well as Szeth.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan enters the kitchen, trying to imitate the maid's mannerisms. The cook addresses her and gives her tasks to do, and Shallan just nods without speaking so as to not blow her cover. Shallan almost runs into Amaram who she thought wasn't going to be in his home, and panics. She follows Amaram toward the room she wants to enter, and confronts him, saying that a messenger is waiting outside to give him a message, and he leaves to investigate. Shallan asks Pattern to pick the lock and she enters the shuttered room which turns out to be filled with maps.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin realizes he has to get over fear of injury and is able to jump on the wall without stumbling or falling, then back onto the floor.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan asks Pattern to act as lookout while she peruses the maps and predictions for highstorms. She takes memories of the maps which focus on the Shattered Plains and are more detailed than any she had seen before. She also deciphers the handwritten stormwarden glyphs though she is puzzled by them as they aren't meant to form sentences, and realizes that Amaram intends to find out from the Parshendi how to return the Voidbringers, and to reach the center of the Shattered Plains before Dalinar's army. She theorizes that Jasnah, the Ghostbloods and Amaram all are interested in the same things. She also realizes that she has to avoid alerting Amaram that his private room was infiltrated.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin becomes more comfortable in jumping between the ground and walls and tells Sylphrena that everything about himself changed to allow this.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan returns to the kitchen disguised as Amaram using Pattern to imitate the brightlord's voice. She tells the cook that Telesh was on a secret mission for Amaram and that the cook is to pretend that she knows nothing of where Telesh was that evening and to not mention this conversation to Amaram at any point. Shallan then leaves the manor and changes her guise back to that of the messenger boy and returns to the front of the building as Hav and Amaram walk up. She says she has a message from Shallan Davar to request a time to sketch his Shardblade to which Amaram acquiesces. Amaram summons his Shardblade and Shallan realizes that it used to belong to her brother, Helaran.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin runs along the walls and leaps chasms and plateaus, draining all his gems and glowing with Stormlight. Sylphrena follows him along with dozens of windspren.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan requests the background of the Shardblade and Amaram lies and says he got it from a young Veden man who tried to assassinate him, and she thinks that Amaram killed Helaran. She then takes her leave, realizing that Helaran was caught up in the conspiracy. She cries, now knowing for sure her brother is dead.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin Lashes himself over the plateaus and hovers in place, noticing a pattern in the plains beneath him. As he stays in the same place, the windspren leave him. Kaladin asks if Sylphrena was with him as a child and she says yes and no. Kaladin says that all his skill was due to her, but she says that it was due to both of them, which Kaladin accepts. Sylphrena says that Szeth's weapon is special and was made to give abilities to men in the same way their bond does. Kaladin asks if a new unstained Blade can be forged and Syl says yes but doesn't say how. Syl confronts Kaladin on informing Dalinar about Moash's patriot friends and Kal replies that he wants to consider it some more first.

Adolin duels Elit with precision, realizing that his previous tactics didn't persuade anyone into accepting his challenges. Adolin wears down Elit with small strikes to his armor, causing many small cracks until Elit's armor eventually is drained of Stormlight and he is unable to move. Adolin shoves Elit who falls to the ground, and is awarded judgment.

Adolin retires to his staging room where Renarin and Navani wait. Shallan shows up to congratulate him. Navani compliments Shallan and leaves before Shallan can say anything and Adolin says to give her time to grieve. Shallan says that she wants to have dinner and a walk with Adolin the next day and says that her research says that if Adolin wins his next bout in a spectacular fashion it could help him with his duels. Relis Ruthar storms into the staging area demanding the bout be nullified but Highjudge Istow refuses. Adolin offers to wager six shards and fight Relis alongside whoever Relis chooses and Relis accepts to duel in two days. Shallan explains her plan to Adolin.

:''Ishevev 1173''

Kaladin guards Adolin as they get a carriage to bring them to Sebarial's warcamp to meet Shallan. Kaladin recognizes Wit as the carriage driver and is surprised. Wit berates Kaladin for abandoning his flute and mocks his lack of eloquent retorts to Wit's insults. Wit implies that he knows of Kaladin's abilities and asks Kaladin to tell him a story as they ride. When they stop to pick up Shallan, Adolin realizes Wit is the driver and exclaims as such. Shallan also exclaims upon seeing Wit and hugs him, which surprises Adolin. Kaladin joins the two betrothed in the carriage to better watch Shallan, and Adolin and Shallan flirt. They decide to go to see a menagerie. Shallan reads an account of a highprince named Yenev who was killed in a duel by Sadeas by the Right of Challenge and King's Boon because Yenev opposed Gavilar's unification campaign. Shallan says that Adolin can try to invoke this boon to challenge Sadeas, if he wins his upcoming duel spectacularly. Kaladin surmises that this boon could help him deal with Amaram. Kaladin decides that Shallan is not a danger to Adolin and that Adolin is falling for her.

They arrive at the menagerie and discover Wit has already departed. Syl admonishes Kaladin for his sour mood as they walk through the menagerie. Shallan draws sketches of the various animals and chats with Adolin. Syl asks Kaladin if he is almost ready, and he replies yes. Amaram and Dalinar appear at the menagerie. Amaram is wearing a distinctive cloak and Dalinar announces that he is refounding the Knights Radiant and that Amaram is their leader.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishevah 1173''

Kaladin and Sigzil discuss Amaram's lack of surgebinding ability as they arrive at the dueling arena. With the entire Kholin household in attendance, Kaladin brings every guard that he could. Kaladin feels anger that Amaram is honored by his appointment by Dalinar after what Kaladin told Dalinar about Amaram, and decides that he has to do something about it if Dalinar won't. Sigzil suggests that Kaladin reveal his powers and join Dalinar's Knights but Kaladin ignores this and sends Sigzil to pass his orders to the guards. Kaladin orders Moash to lead a patrol duty the next day so that he is away when Graves is dealt with.

Adolin speaks with his Shardblade to prepare for his duel. He burns a glyphward painted by Shallan and tells Navani to give her a chance. They discuss the plan regarding the boon and some changes to the terms of the duel. They review Adolin's preparations and Adolin gets anxious when he realizes he doesn't have his mother's bracelet as a good luck charm. Adolin enters the dueling arena and waves to Shallan and checks to see if Sadeas is there. His opponents enter the arena and he is shocked that there are four instead of two like he expected.

Dalinar questions Sadeas about what is happening and Sadeas proclaims ignorance, until Elhokar questions him. Sadeas replies that since Adolin wasn't specific enough when naming the terms of the duel that he would be subject to a full disadvantaged duel. Dalinar tells Elhokar that Adolin would have to forfeit but Elhokar dissuades him, and the duel begins.

Adolin curses himself as he realizes his mistake in the way he issued and accepted the duel challenge. He realizes the four opponents include Relis, Elit, Abrobadar and Jakamav. Adolin puts his back to a wall so he doesn't get surrounded, and Zahel shouts advice to him to try to fight them one at a time. Adolin takes an offensive approach and does well until Jakamav is able to surprise him with a hammer blow. Adolin tries to yield but in the chaos of the duel is ignored, and he realizes that he might be severely injured.

Dalinar realizes that Adolin can have two fellow duelists under the terms of the challenge and asks for Elhokar's Shardblade but the king refuses, since that would endanger Dalinar. Sadeas taunts Dalinar for not going into the arena to help Adolin. Dalinar watches alarmed as Renarin - without Shardplate - goes to help his brother.

Adolin battles on and tries to get some breathing room so that he can signal the judge to yield, but Relis threatens to have Renarin severely injured or killed if Adolin doesn't keep fighting and accept punishment for what he did to Elit. Adolin reluctantly agrees, but berates his supposed friend Jakamav.

Dalinar implores Istow to end the fight, then says he will end it since she ignores him, but she replies that her authority supersedes him in the arena. Renarin fights Abrobadar, but he is hopelessly outclassed. Abrodar seems content to only stop Renarin reaching Adolin, and does not fight to maim as the other three gang up on Adolin, and one of Adolin's shoulder segments breaks. Dalinar addresses the crowd, asking for someone to aid his sons. He looks at Amaram, who averts his eyes. Kaladin then volunteers to aid them, telling Dalinar to take care of his men if it goes poorly, then he jumps into the arena with his spear.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishevah 1173''
Shallan wonders why Adolin doesn't surrender since he is outmatched, and berates herself for not seeing the loophole and failing her betrothed. She briefly considers jumping into the arena but discards that idea. She tells Pattern to try to distract Abrobadar to help out Renarin. She watches as Kaladin joins the fight.

Kaladin tells Sylphrena that this better end differently than when he saved Amaram, and Sylphrena says that it will. Relis ignores Kaladin and pays the price as he gets stabbed in a crack in his armor. Kaladin guards Adolin's back and says that Adolin will need to break their foes' Shardplate for him. Adolin says for Kaladin to distract one foe and to watch out for Renarin while he fights the other two and Kaladin agrees. Kaladin draws Relis' attention while Adolin fights Elit and Jakamav. Relis fights Kaladin for a short time but then goes back to fight Adolin who is skillfully dueling his two foes, so Kaladin uses a Lashing-enhanced kick to knock Relis down, breaking his own legs in the process, though he is able to heal them. Kaladin sees that he cracked some of Relis' shards. Adolin's own armor is mostly cracked but he gets a strong blow at Elit and cracks his chestplate, slowing Elit greatly. Kaladin sees Abrobadar waving his blade at the ground and Sylphrena exclaims about something mysterious and flies over toward Renarin. Kaladin uses his broken spear to strike Elit in his exposed armor and forces him to yield. The remaining three opponents gather to battle Adolin, leaving Renarin alone to sit in the sand. Kaladin demands Elit's helm and is given it; he puts it on his hand as an armored glove, and arms himself with a knife to help Adolin. Kaladin tricks Relis into backing away then he goes to help Adolin. Relis and Jakamav both try to attack Kaladin with Sylphrena circling around him, and he dodges their Shardblades or blocks them with the helm until he runs out of Stormlight, realizing the helm drained it from him. Kaladin is backed against a wall, but Adolin appears and grapples Jakamav to the ground. Kaladin sees that Abrobadar was just defeated. Relis, the last man standing, rushes toward Renarin and Kaladin follows, yelling at Renarin to yield but he only dismisses his blade and does nothing. Relis raises his blade toward Renarin but is reluctant to kill him; when Kaladin draws close, Relis turns to swing at Kaladin. In desperation, Kaladin successfully performs a lastclap, catching the blade. He hears a scream that sounds like Sylphrena; Relis too hears the scream and drops the blade, fleeing the arena and forfeiting the duel. Jakamav yells at Adolin to fight him as he is held down and Kaladin walks up to him with his knife and places it by a crack in his armor and tells him to yield or else. Jakamav yields and Adolin is declared victor. Adolin laughs joyously at the spoils he won and asks Kaladin to help him remove his drained armor.

Elhokar announces how impressed he is by Adolin and offers him a boon. Kaladin notices Sadeas trying to leave the arena, but before he does, Adolin demands the right to duel Sadeas. Kaladin immediately demands to challenge Amaram for the crimes of murder and obstruction of justice, causing Amaram to cower. Adolin groans and the crowd goes silent. Elhokar orders Kaladin to be arrested.

Lift and six other thieves climb over a wall of the [[Bronze Palace]] as they intend to rob it while a new [[Prime Aqasix]] is being chosen by the vizierate. Lift sees Nale in the distance and frets that he is still pursuing her somehow. The thieves climb up the palace wall and Lift chats with her spren Wyndle, who says that he wanted to choose someone else with whom to bond but ended up with Lift since she had visited the Old Magic. Lift and Wyndle bicker as they infiltrate the palace. Huqin says they are there to steal clothes which aren't well guarded but will sell for a lot. Lift disobeys Huqin and wanders the palace with Gawx accompanying her. Lift tells Gawx that she wants to steal the prime's food and she heads towards the Prime's chambers while he goes to the vizier quarters to find spheres. Wyndle helps her further infiltrate the palace while he teaches Lift about spren and her odd ability to convert food into Stormlight. Lift sneaks into the dining area and hides under the table as the vizierate reviews applications for Emperor. Lift listens as they debate what to do since no one wants to be Prime due to the recent assassinations. She steals a dinner roll then hesitates as she notices that Nale is there. She tries to flee but is caught, and Nale has her arrested and tells the vizierate that he has the proper forms. She tries to use her ability to escape but is inhibited by a larkin which drains her Stormlight. The head vizier protests that Lift will be executed for mere thievery, but Nale adds the crimes of trespass and interrupting a holy conclave in session.

Lift escapes long enough to get a half-eaten roll which she quickly eats before being captured again. After a short time, Lift gains enough Stormlight to evade her captors, though she sees Nale has abilities also as he chases her carrying a Shardblade. One of Nale's companions slits Gawx's throat, and Nale recaptures Lift, then berates his ally for killing the boy without filling out the correct paperwork. Lift escapes but then decides to save Gawx because someone has to care, and Wyndle says that her regrowth ability could help if she was more trained. She returns to Gawx' body and breathes Stormlight into his mouth before Nale again captures her and identifies her as an Edgedancer and tells her about their order. Nale says he hunts her because her abilities could bring Desolations back to the world. Nale draws his Shardblade to kill her but she is suddenly pardoned by the new Prime Aqasix, Gawx, who was elected due to his miracle survival. Nale obeys the pardon to release Lift and praises Yaezir and leaves. Lift congratulates Gawx on his election and asks for food.

She meets the others of the ruling council, with her sister Venli having taken stormform as well. Eshonai tells them that they need to transform more of their people to be ready for the Alethi push toward Narak, so they can summon a highstorm to use as a weapon. Eshonai tunes out the voice within that is screaming and attunes joy and tells how awesome she feels. Zuln dissents from Eshonai's proposal, saying it is not right. The meeting breaks up and Venli and Eshonai discuss their options for getting consensus on their plan and Venli says that she knew what the stormform would do to Eshonai, angering her sister. Eshonai asks how Venli knew but she doesn't answer. Eshonai addresses a crowd and tells them that the Five want to forbid the new form but that she will allow anyone who wishes to join her in a highstorm to transform, then she generates a miniature storm for them to see as a demonstration of her new ability, impressing the onlookers. She then asks for volunteers from her soldiers for the new form and is happy that almost no one refuses her. She then tells the soldiers that she wants to transform all the civilians also, and has them go through the city get volunteers and segregate anyone who refuses the transformation. Venli says that those unwilling to transform must be killed and Eshonai says that will happen after her soldiers all take stormform. Abronai refuses the transformation and is grouped with the dissenters, along with Zuln. Thude confronts Eshonai on her changes in behavior and attitude but she defends her actions as necessary to their people's survival. Eshonai sends Thude to guard the dissenters, which include her own mother. As she prepares to speak to her entire people, Varanis tells her that the dissenters escaped, helped by Thude, but Eshonai says not to pursue them since they will not survive the next highstorm anyway. Venli confronts Eshonai, who threatens to kill her sister but doesn't since she needs Venli for the [[stormspren]]. Eshonai lets Venli go and addresses the listeners as she planned.

Kaladin feels claustrophobic in his prison cell. Kaladin asks Sylphrena if she would help him break out if he wanted to and she says yes, but then inquires why he would break out since he entered there willingly.  He hears a disturbance but isn't able to find out what causes it. He says he won't be executed and that he doesn't trust Dalinar anymore because Dalinar allowed his imprisonment and that he is the same as the other lighteyes. Sylphrena asks him to repeat that and he is unable since he can't easily lie to his spren. Kaladin speaks out against Elhokar, saying the kingdom would be better off without him, and says that this is no different than when he was a slave, and Sylphrena doesn't contradict him.

Wit appears, sitting on a bench outside his cell, tuning a musical instrument and mentioning his perfect pitch and saying that he came for the story that he previously requested at their last meeting. Kaladin says he isn't in the mood but after some verbal sparring, Wit starts playing his instrument which affects Kaladin internally. Wit asks Kaladin to close his eyes and describe what he sees, and Kaladin thinks of a race, and says as such, and Wit sings lyrics that rhyme and repeat Kaladin's story in musical form, accompanying with his instrument. As Wit sings the story of Fleet, Kaladin pictures it in his mind, and each time Wit pauses, Kaladin tells Fleet's tale for Wit to expound upon. Fleet races against a highstorm from the eastern sea to the lands of Shinovar and reaches safety but dies due to his effort, causing the storm to stop, though Fleet's soul then rises to win the race and ride the winds thereafter. Wit tells Kaladin about the nature of stories and accepts the ending that Kaladin gave this tale and asks Kaladin what the meaning of this story was. Kaladin says that the storm caught Fleet, and Wit says the storm catches everyone and does it matter, and Kaladin says he doesn't know. Wit says that's good since Kaladin now has something to ponder on.

:''One and a half years ago''

Shallan has become the perfect daughter. She keeps quiet now, particularly around her father, and spends most of her days in her rooms. Her father had proven several times that he wouldn't hurt Shallan if she angered him, but would beat others in her name. The only time she drops her mask now is with her brothers, making jokes to try to drive back the darkness in their home.

She is also more involved in keeping [[House Davar]]'s accounts, and their fortunes seem to have improved. Her father has shrewdly stopped being bullied by the other lighteyes and has started playing them off each other. New marble deposits have been discovered, which provide resources to keep up with his promises, bribes, and deals. Shallan hopes this will improve her father's temperament, but it doesn't.

Lin and Balat are arguing about who he will marry. Balat wants to marry [[Eylita Tavinar]], but his father thinks she's of too low a status. He wants Balat to marry [[Sudi Valam]], daughter of [[Highprince]] [[Valam]], who is a widow in her fifties. Their argument escalates and Balat calls his father a murderer. In response, Lin coldly orders one of his new guards to kill Balat's new [[axehound]] pups. Balat is outraged and tells his father that [[Helaran]] is back, and that they had met only two days past. They lock eyes, then Balat stalks out of the room.

Shallan finds Balat in the kennel, where his new pod of axehound pups were dead in a pool of violet blood. She'd encouraged him to breed them and he'd been making progress with his demons over the years, rarely hurting anything larger than a cremling now. They discuss fleeing their house, and Balat tells her he wants to go to live in [[Vedenar]] with Eylita. Shallan says she can't go but will try to think of a way for them to escape, and returns to the house.

While passing her father's door Shallan overhears him talking to [[Rin]], one of the house's new guards. Her father tells Rin to find Helaran, ambush him, and bring back his head. He offers Helaran's [[Shardblade]] as payment. Malise, having also apparently overheard this, is shocked that her husband would order the murder of his own son. A violent, angry argument breaks out, and Rin leaves.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishashev 1173''

Kaladin wakes up in his cell resigned to the monotony of solitude and darkness. He sees a strange spren that looks like taut wires. He talks to Syl who is nearby but hidden and tells him about a Cryptic, a revolting kind of spren who hid from Syl before she could find it, though she realizes that the Cryptic may be trying to bond another Radiant and that Kal may not be alone in the near future.

Dalinar shows up and Kaladin salutes him by reflex. Dalinar tells Kaladin to pretend he is guarding the prison cell and that Elhokar may relent soon and allow Kal to be released once the pardon doesn't make the king seem too ambivalent. Dalinar says that his men are being taken care of and that his reputation with Dalinar is not harmed, but Kaladin retorts that the king has a history of allowing people to rot in prison, and Dalinar knows about the situation that Kal is talking about and says he would prefer to not speak of the Roshone affair, which shocks Kaladin. Kaladin asks for a further explanation and Dalinar gives it reluctantly. Dalinar says that he wanted to demote Roshone but was overridden and ended up exiling him where he could do no harm, not knowing what happened later in Hearthstone. Kaladin says the mercy shown Roshone is rarely granted to darkeyes, and Dalinar replies that Kaladin is in a special position and that he has to show extra loyalty. Dalinar also explains that he trusts his instincts about Kaladin as a man that can help inspire positive change in the kingdom, and that he wants Kaladin to lead by example and not act erratically.

After Dalinar leaves, Kaladin discusses the revelations with Syl and blames his family's misfortunes on Elhokar. Kaladin concludes that Moash is right and that the king must die.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishashah 1173''

Shallan and Pattern hide in one of her illusions to watch a drop location secretly for anyone to try to leave instructions for her, while she chats with Adolin via spanreed. Shallan decides she must be irresistible to Adolin to keep his interest. She asks Pattern why Mraize didn't send instructions via spanreed and realizes that the Ghostbloods are trying to spy on her. She tells Pattern to find the spy and he locates Iyatil. Adolin sends a message that Shallan can join a scouting trip to the Shattered Plains as she requested, but she says she hopes to find a live chasmfiend for her research. She gives an excuse to Adolin to end their spanreed conversation, then destroys her illusion, and creates a new one of Veil attached to Pattern and tells him to make it seem that Veil is retrieving something from the tree, then to go to an adjacent alleyway. Shallan waits outside Iyatil's room, disguised as Veil, and confronts her when Iyatil enters the hallway, explaining how she was tricked by her "double". Iyatil gives her name and explains that Shallan has an urgent task to investigate a new arrival in Dalinar's camp and that she is to watch while Shallan performs it. Shallan tells Iyatil that she can join her instead of following her secretly.

Shallan and Iyatil ride in a palanquin as Shallan reads her instructions to investigate a supposed madman that Dalinar and Elhokar are interested in. Iyatil reveals that Mraize is her student, not her master, and that she wears a mask to reserve herself and allow her to adapt. Shallan removes her disguise without letting Iyatil notice by using the palinquin's curtains for concealment and is immediately recognized and permitted into Dalinar's camp. She has Pattern make a distraction so that she can withdraw into the palanquin and resume Veil's appearance without Iyatil noticing. Iyatil tries to guess how Shallan got them past the guards and Shallan flashes an enigmatic smile. The palanquin proceeds to their destination, and Shallan deceives an ardent into thinking that her sister needs medical attention for a psychological impairment, and they are admitted to the temple.

While some ardents try to diagnose Iyatil, Shallan sneaks off and creates an illusion of one of the ardents to move freely around the temple. Pattern locates the madman for her and picks the lock so that they can enter his dark cell. The man is whispering about the Return of Desolation and needing to prepare, and calls himself Talenel'Elin. She tells Pattern that she doubts that the man is one of the Heralds. Taln repeats his words and Shallan writes them down, since he doesn't answer her other questions. Shallan tries to recreate her illusion, but Taln sees this and grabs her and holds her against the wall in alarm, and speaks of one of Ishar's knights, then goes back to his bed and lies down and repeats the same whispers. Shallan summons her Shardblade to defend herself but doesn't need it. Her mind blanks out and she thinks of Mother's soul, then she wakes up and Pattern asks if she is crazy, and she replies yes. She goes to leave the room, but sees Amaram approaching it.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishashah 1173''

Kaladin sits in his cell, moping and feeling dejected. He tries to absorb Stormlight from a sphere outside his cell, and has brief difficulty before he is able to soak it into his fingertips. Sylphrena appears and says she is worried about Kaladin growing dark. Feeling slightly better, Kaladin takes his meal as a puzzled guard swaps out the dun sphere.

Shallan panics, but thinks quickly and creates an illusion of darkness to conceal herself within the cell. Amaram and Bordin enter the cell and close the door. Shallan feels muted anger at seeing Helaran's killer though she realizes that her brother may have been killed in self-defense as a possible assassin. Amaram looks at Taln and proclaims that his and Gavilar's plan has succeeded. Bordin tells Amaram that Taln spoke of a cache of Shardblades once to Bordin and Amaram asks Bordin to take him to the location before someone else finds it, and the two depart. Shallan feels like she is in over her head with the conspiracies, though Pattern doesn't understand her analogy.

Shallan returns to say goodbye to Iyatil after giving her the transcription of Taln's ramblings and a brief description of Amaram's visit. After verifying that Iyatil can escape on her own, Shallan apologizes to the ardents for getting lost in the temple and prepares to leave. Iyatil says how impressed she is, and asks who Shallan really is, and Shallan replies that she is a seeker of truth.

Shallan then tells Iyatil that she will send a full report to Mraize.  Mraize indicates that Shallan has proven herself and is safe from any danger from the other Ghostbloods, and that Shallan is to get a tattoo anywhere on her person to symbolize her loyalty to the Ghostbloods and that she is now admitted as a member of their group.

;Plot Summary
:''One and a half years ago''

Shallan is in her room. Not two hours have passed since her father ordered Helaran's assassination, and a pair of guards have been stationed outside in the hallway. She suspects the guards are there to keep her stepmother from trying to flee, though she doesn't even know whether Malise is still alive. She quietly slips from her room and walks toward the guards, hands trembling. She doesn't know them, all of the guards she'd grown up with have been replaced. One of the men puts his hand up to stop her, but she keeps walking, insisting that her father will need her. As she passes her father's door, she can hear Malise softly weeping.

Shallan finds her father slumped at the high table in the feast hall, but slips into the kitchen before he notices her. She mixes his favorite drink; deep violet wine warmed and spiced with cinnamon. When she returns to the feast hall and gives it to him, she looks into his eyes. She doesn't see the darkness there, which is very rare these days. Lin complains that no one listens to him, and that his house should support him. Shallan tells him that she'll speak with them and goes outside into the night air.

She finds Balat laying on a bench in the gardens. He's been ripping the claws off of [[cremling|cremlings]] again. Shallan tells him that their father can't control himself anymore, and that he ordered the assassination of Helaran. They make a plan for Balat and Malise to escape with a letter from Shallan to warn their brother.

Shallan then returns to the house and goes to her father's sitting room. The guards stop her, but she holds her ground despite her fear, and they eventually let her pass. This is the first time she's entered this room in years, and she has to raise a hand to shade her eyes against the light coming from behind the painting. It is blinding to her and she wonders how anyone can stand it. Malise, curled up in a chair with her lip split and her arm broken, says that Lin will kill them all. Shallan starts treating the wounds, and tells her stepmother about the escape plan. As Shallan is about to leave, Malise asks her "If I go, and Balat with me, who will he hate? Who will he hit? Maybe you, finally? The one who actually deserves it?" Shallan just replies, "Maybe."

;Plot Summary
:''Ishabev 1173''
Kaladin mopes in his cell, imagining paranoid fantasies of his incompetence and of bridge four placating him by saying they like to be bodyguards. Kaladin snaps to alertness as a jailer says he is pardoned with no loss of rank and free to go. Kaladin vows that he will never be imprisoned again by anyone as he leaves. He figures he was there for several weeks based on his beard. They pass another cell where Adolin is locked up, and he leaves his cell as well, and the jailer explains that Adolin demanded to be locked up until Kaladin was freed. Adolin says that he did this because it wasn't right for Kaladin to be locked up, since Kaladin saved his life and that of his brother's. The two banter and reconcile, and Adolin holds Elhokar responsible for the failure of their plan. Kaladin confirms that he was telling the truth when he accused Amaram and Adolin believes him despite Dalinar's friendship with Amaram. They enter another room where most of bridge four awaits Kaladin to celebrate his liberation. Adolin calls for quiet and says that after the other shards were distributed, there was a full set remaining which he gives to Kaladin. Kaladin gives them to Moash, and Adolin objects until Kaladin explains his dislike of Shardblades, and that he is more than capable on the battlefield even without shards as he showed in the arena, for when Szeth returns, and that they would have an additional shard bearer for that confrontation in Moash. Adolin tells Moash to take the shards and that he will now be a lighteyes and can start his own house or join one of Dalinar's. Moash takes up the Shardblade, amassing gloryspren, and has the armorers put the armor on him. Bridge four then returns to their barracks to eat some stew that has been simmering the entire time that Kaladin was locked up. Teft brings Kaladin up to speed on bridge four's activities and emotions while he was away.

Kaladin talks privately with Moash and says he agrees with the plan to remove Elhokar, and Moash is pleased and that they will possibly deal with Amaram next. Moash decides to go to the sparring grounds to practice, and Kaladin returns to the barracks to feast.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishakan 1173''

Dalinar and Navani watch two armies return from a hunt, and one of their guards leaves to get a status report. Dalinar thinks how disciplined bridge four is, and how Kaladin fit the ideal of the type of officer that Dalinar looked for. Navani talks about possible usages for fabrials and how gemstones weren't always used to bond Shardblades, a fact which alters their understanding of Shardblades. As she talks, he thinks about his more urgent preparations for their expedition to the Shattered Plains. She notices his distracted state and comments on it, then expresses her ongoing grief for the loss of Jasnah and Dalinar comforts her. Navani asks how Dalinar coped when shshshsh died, but he doesn't answer, though he thinks how he couldn't remember his wife anymore due to a hole in his memories. Dalinar mentions the secrets hidden by Gavilar and Navani says she will try to find something in her journals about that, though she has already checked many times. Dalinar says their immediate concern is the feast they are attending, and Navani admonishes him to try to be encouraging instead of contemptful of the other highprinces, before they separate to the gender segregated islands of the feast.

Dalinar goes to the king's island, noticing that people seem to be paying more attention to him as he walks by. Dalinar steps up to Vamah and inquires about his hunt strategy, but Vamah's response is interrupted by several people laughing nearby, and Dalinar leaves to investigate, ending up face to face with Aladar and Sadeas. Dalinar confronts them but they feign ignorance and walk away. Dalinar looks around for someone else to question, then hears Wit welcome Amaram to the feast with insults, though Amaram responds in a friendly manner. Dalinar asks Amaram about some papers being distributed, but is constantly interrupted by Wit's remarks until Dalinar and Amaram walk away from him. Amaram tells Dalinar that the papers have accounts of Dalinar's visions as dictated to Navani. Dalinar tells Amaram to bring Navani to him but she is already heading to him. Dalinar asks Amaram's opinion and he replies that he thinks the visions are authentic and meaningful for their roles as recreators of the Radiants. Dalinar asks about Taln, and Amaram replies that he is still investigating. Amaram also comments on his lack of faith in Kaladin's ability to protect Dalinar and that he would like an apology from him. Navani brings some of the papers, and tells Dalinar that the words and tone were changed to make it seem that Navani was humoring Dalinar by transcribing the visions, and that a mocking commentary was added. Dalinar asks if the visions were changed and Navani replies that they were not, and Dalinar says he will not be bothered by this attempt to embarrass him, and he quotes from The Way of Kings to shield himself from ridicule. Dalinar stands on a table to address the crowd and says that the accounts of the visions are accurate, despite the mocking tone and commentary, and that in the future he will have the accounts of his visions published for scholars to investigate. He vows that he will be vindicated instead of broken and says that he will talk to each of them individually and ask them to speak their minds to his face instead of anonymously.

Dalinar sits down to rest after hours of politicking and talking up his expedition to the Shattered Plains. Wit approaches and compliments Dalinar on his approach to dealing with the insults. Wit implies that Dalinar outshines Elhokar in importance, and Dalinar asks if he is a tyrant, and Wit replies that he is but that he is a benevolent one, which is preferable to a weak ruler, and what the world needs currently. Wit said that what was done to unify the kingdom years ago was good work, but Dalinar complains about how weak the kingdom is because of the means they used in unification, and that more than benevolent tyranny is needed according to Nohadon. Wit cryptically comments that he has to go somewhere but he doesn't know why, and when asked, denies that he is a Radiant or Herald, and that their goals do not completely align and that Wit would watch the world crumble and burn to get what he needs, though not happily, and that Dalinar can't trust Wit. Wit says that he will try to help carefully but must avoid being destroyed by Dalinar's enemy, the father of hatred.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishakach 1173''

Kaladin is on a scouting expedition to the Shattered Plains and has bad memories of being a bridgeman. He frets that he is unable to absorb Stormlight unless Sylphrena is near him, and she admonishes him for being naughty and acts capriciously toward him. He grows angry that Syl doesn't agree with his decision and says he is broken, to which she replies that all the old knights were. Kaladin decides to ignore her and enjoy the company of Bridge Four as they reach a plateau with a permanent scouting location. He overhears a scout tell Dalinar that a glowing flying man was spotted in the Plains, and Dalinar believes that this was Szeth, though it was actually Kaladin. Dalinar and Kaladin discuss how Renarin is fitting in with Bridge Four and if that is affecting him positively or not.

Kaladin has more difficulty absorbing Stormlight, finds Sylphrena later, almost acting like a windspren, and she tells Kaladin to decide what he wants, and he realizes he made two conflicting promises to Moash and Dalinar which violates the code of Honor. He asks for advice and Sylphrena tells him to find the Words, and then she flies away.

Shallan draws a sketch of one of the mechanical bridges being unfolded, and Kaladin also watches, and recognizes one of the carpenters. Moash shows up in his shards and salutes Kaladin, though he now outranks him, and says he will always be part of Bridge Four, even as a lighteyes. Moash says that the assassination plot is close to fruition, and that they only need Kaladin to create an opening, which makes him worry over what Sylphrena told him. Adolin and Kaladin discuss contingencies for a possible attack by Szeth, and Adolin asks for advice about women. Adolin tries to get Kaladin to reveal his abilities but fails. Shallan joins them and starts sketching some moss, and they banter a bit, with Shallan getting upset that Kaladin insulted Adolin and that Kal acts so negatively despite Adolin's positive attitude.

Kaladin rejoins Bridge Four to carry their mobile bridge over the mechanical one, toward their destination where a chasmfiend was slain, and where Shallan plans to study the chrysalis. They reach the destination, and the carpenter that Kaladin recognized calls to Dalinar who crosses the bridge. Kaladin realizes the carpenter worked in Sadeas' lumberyard and cries out a warning. He gets Adolin and Dalinar off the bridge but is too late as the carpenter throws an emergency lever that causes the bridge to collapse with Kaladin and Shallan still on it.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin falls into the chasm and is able to absorb a bit of Stormlight through desperate effort though he hears a pained scream from Sylphrena as he does so, and hits the ground, falling unconscious. He awakes in darkness, since all his spheres were drained, and great pain, and hears a voice asking what has he done. Syl's scream haunts him. He is uninjured and gets to his feet, and runs into Shallan, and lies about how he survived, and Shallan explains how the bridge was collapsed. They search the bridge wreckage and find several bodies but don't see Dalinar or Adolin. Kaladin thinks that he somehow saved Shallan. Kaladin says that there was a parshendi attack right before the bridge fell, and that means that Dalinar probably retreated. Kaladin tells Shallan that they may have been rescued by a windspren as in folktales. Kaladin and Shallan discuss how they will survive and what dangers they may face, the worst of which is a highstorm due the following night. They decide to set out immediately for the warcamps.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan is both annoyed and pleased to find Kaladin survived, and thinks that she saved both of them somehow. As they walk, she notices how much plantlife there is in the chasm. Kaladin walks silently and asks if Shallan will constantly chat as they travel and ignores her response, focusing on finding the shortest path back to the warcamps. Shallan tries to get Kaladin to relax but he reveals his prejudice against lighteyes and she says he only uses that as an excuse to be obnoxious. He brings up the incident with the boots, but then reveals that he doesn't have a grudge and that he doesn't actually dislike her as he does other lighteyes. Shallan is insulted and they start an argument that is cut off as they hear a loud scraping noise that seems to be approaching them. They realize the danger they are in, and begin to run.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin and Shallan flee as they are chased by a chasmfiend. Shallan chooses a path and orders Kaladin to follow her. They stop and Kaladin covers his Stormlight, and he realizes that she lured the chasmfiend back to their original location to the fresh corpses for food. Shallan decides she wants to see the chasmfiend, and get close to take a look at it as it fills the chasm and has small glowing spren around it like the spren that follow skyeels. They leave before the chasmfiend finishes its meal.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan lets Kaladin lead, though she tries to keep track of where she is, and dwells on the chasmfiend. She grows tired now that all her Stormlight is drained. Kaladin says they should stop so they don't risk getting lost and going the wrong direction, and wants to wait until daybreak to get their bearings. They banter for a bit, with less antagonism, and Shallan sketches their path through the chasms in the form of a map, which impresses Kaladin.

'''Shallan'''

Kaladin wakes her up after a short sleep, before daybreak. They set out, and when the sun rises, they think they are going the right direction. They banter further, with Shallan dishing out lighthearted insults while Kaladin resists replying in kind unlike his earlier behavior. Kaladin asks why Shallan came to the Shattered Plains and she becomes serious, replying that she was trying to continue Jasnah's important research, and that Adolin was an added bonus. Kaladin asks if she was there to investigate the strange structures that they saw and she tries to dissemble but he sees through it, and explains his original suspicions of her. She says that she wants the parshmen exiled before they betray the Alethi, and he replies that they might be replaced with regular Alethi slaves and she empathizes with his former plight as a slave. Shallan tries to be lighthearted but Kaladin will have none of it, though he tries to not argue either. Kaladin explains that he thinks she is a typical pampered sheltered lighteyes which Shallan rephrases back as self-contradictory and convoluted, and Kaladin sees the flaws in his argument. Shallan tells Kaladin that she won't harm the Kholins and she is sincere in trying to prevent disaster, and he accepts this. Kaladin then checks their bearings and realize they are going the wrong direction.

Teft and Sigzil are in the warcamp, sitting vigil for Kaladin, and Teft speaks of his childhood and of what his parents did as [[Envisagers]]. They knew things about the Radiants, and some Envisagers including his parents attempted suicidal stunts to see if they would manifest powers, and Teft ended up turning them into the authorities who had them executed. Dalinar shows up and inquires about their vigil and Teft proclaims that Kaladin definitely survived despite falling into the chasm. Sigzil proclaims his belief in Kaladin's return and Dalinar just tells them to not overextend themselves or stay out during highstorms, though the highprince believes that Kaladin is dead.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin feels like a fool for leading them in the wrong direction. He calls out for Syl but gets no answer. He also feels like a fool for the way he treats Shallan and for the incorrect assumptions he made about her. He compliments Shallan on her drawing ability as she sketches a more accurate map of the Plains, though it is getting much sooner until the next highstorm. She traces a couple of the plateaus nearby by walking around them, and Kaladin notices her having a mysterious conversation with someone and speculates that she might be a Radiant talking to a spren.

Shallan says that some of the series of plateaus are mirror images of others and Kaladin says that the Plains are symmetrical and that he knew that from a dream, and Shallan says she knows where the Parshendi are, and the Oathgate, and that she can map all of it since the Plains were not a natural forming pattern, but rather created through cymatics.

They follow a revised path based on Shallan's map, though they have to periodically check their route, slowing down their escape. Kaladin occasionally shouts up from the chasm to try to get the attention of Alethi scouts, but no one answers. Kaladin grows moody because he feels that he failed them, but Shallan tries to remain optimistic. Kaladin says he wished he could be like Shallan, but then Shallan describes how it is like to be depressed and hopeless and he understands that she wasn't always happy, but she somehow muddles through anyway, which inspires him. They banter again with Shallan trying to improve Kaladin's mood again like she used to do with her brothers, and he goes along with their jokes to an extent.

The chasmfiend shows up again, and they try to flee, hiding in a narrow fissure. The chasmfiend fails to reach them, but it then settles nearby to wait as the highstorm is rapidly approaching, with about two hours left before it reaches them. Kaladin decides to try to distract the chasmfiend to allow Shallan to escape back to the warcamps with her vital information. He prepares to fight to the death, and tells Shallan to apologize to Adolin on his behalf. Shallan says that before he goes to fight to take her Shardblade.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin asks how Shallan has a Shardblade and she replies that it is unimportant. He brushes against the blade and doesn't hear screams like he did previously in the dueling arena. He reluctantly accepts the blade and Shallan swears him to secrecy, then says she wants to get her satchel. Kaladin distracts the fiend, dodging around it and leading it away from Shallan. He uses the confined space of the chasm to his advantage, and cuts the beast a couple of times, but then gets bitten in the leg as he tries to evade an attack. Shallan distracts the beast and he is able to retrieve the Shardblade but then collapses from pain. He picks up a sphere and tries to drain its Stormlight but only hears distant weeping. He sees an illusion of himself that distracts the beast momentarily before it vanishes in a puff of Stormlight which he somehow thinks that he created. He decides he has to go for the beast's head and stabs at it as its jaws reach for him.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan sees the beast fall on top of Kaladin, and notices some spren around the chasmfiend seeming to leave it. Kaladin's body protrudes from the creature's mouth and she tries to pull him out, and he says ow. They banter as she uses her blade to try to cut him free, and he explains that he stabbed the chasmfiend in the brain to kill it. Once free, Kal asks her to bind his leg for him which she does. They take a brief rest, and despair that the storm will get them anyway. Kaladin then realizes that Shallan could use the Shardblade to cut out a cubbyhole above the waterline in the chasm for them to hide in from the storm and flood waters. She climbs up the dead fiend, then changes her blade to be knife-size and carves handholds in the chasm to climb above the waterline to carve a shelter out for them. They banter as Shallan cuts the rock, and it takes about an hour for her to finish. She uses a vine to help Kaladin climb up to the safe spot just before the floods reach them.

;Plot Summary
:''One year ago''
Shallan and Jushu are in Balat's room helping him prepare to leave. They talk about the valuable deposits of stone recently found on their land, and how they find it strange to be wealthy all of a sudden. Despite the family's wealth, their father's mood has continued to grow darker.

Shallan unfolds and reads a letter. Their contacts haven't been able to find Helaran, who seems to have disappeared. Balat is jumpy, worried that their father will discover that he intends to leave. His plan is to escape with Eylita, and if he can't find Helaran, they'll go to [[Valam|Highprince Valam]] and [[Redin]], who years ago told them he'd listen to anyone willing to testify against their father. Jushu is skeptical, saying that their father is in favor now, and that the highprince is nearly dead.

Wikim slams the door open, telling them that Eylita is in the feast hall, that their father had summoned her. Balat and Wikim rush to find out what is happening. Shallan follows slowly, overwhelmed with panic, but she feels pulled forward. Somehow she knows that this has been coming, that it was inevitable. She collects the pouch of [[blackbane]] that Wikim had given her years ago, and heads downstairs.

Balat is arguing with their father about Eylita. Lin reveals that he knows about their plan to leave. Shallan enters the room and walks along the walls toward the kitchens. She notices something on the floor, blocking the kitchen doors from closing. Lin tells them that Helaran is dead; he died on a battlefield in Alethkar. Shallan reaches the bundle on the floor and realizes it's a body. It is Malise; she'd been killed by several blows to the head. Shallan concludes that he'd discovered the plan, sent for Eylita and waited for her to arrive, and then killed his wife. It was a calculated punishment, not committed in a moment of passion. She moves to where servants had left a pitcher of wine with cups.

Balat unsheathes his sword, followed by Lin. They clash brutally, and Lin is able to swat Balat's sword out of his hand. Lin tells them that he's always despised Balat, and of his sons only Helaran wasn't worthless. Shallan hands him a cup of wine, which he gulps down. Balat grabs his sword and tries to stab their father, but hits something metallic through his coat, which stops the blade. Lin tosses his sword aside and gets an iron poker from the fireplace. He slams it into Balat's leg over and over, berating him about being useless.

Lin's hands start shaking and the poker slips to the ground. Lin is surprised, and he stumbles and falls to his knees, then to his side. Shallan, feeling cold, tells Eylita to bind Balat's wounds, then kneels next to her father. Lin is motionless, staring at the ceiling. After her brothers' initial confusion, Shallan tells them that she poisoned their father by placing the blackbane in his wine. Jushu pulls a [[Soulcasting#Soulcasting_by_the_use_of_a_fabrial|Soulcaster]] out of Lin's pocket, which had apparently been broken while blocking Balat's last strike. Just then, their father starts twitching, and his eyes focus on Shallan. She realizes that the poison has only paralyzed him, and says that they need to finish the job. Everyone else shies away, so she thanks her father for everything he did for her, then wraps her necklace around his neck. She twists the necklace around the handle of a fork for leverage, crying and whispering the lullaby that he'd sung to comfort Shallan in her childhood as he dies.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishakev 1173''

Kaladin reaches the sheltered alcove just before the floodwaters arrive. He and Shallan huddle together against the rock as the waters quickly rise, momentarily cresting over the edge of their carved out cubby. Kaladin tells Shallan how he was left to die in a highstorm by Sadeas. Kal looks up and thinks he sees a giant glowing figure followed by another figure walking in the storm. Shallan asks Kal to tell his story as a means of taking her mind off the highstorm, and he starts from when he was made a slave by Amaram, and speaks of his slavery and Tvlakv, his time with bridge four, and the rescue of Dalinar and fighting the Parshendi shardbearer. He hears chanting and sees strange spren flying around. After he finishes his story, Shallan says she killed her father, and tells about how her mother died, and what her life was like when she was a child. Kaladin realizes how much he had in common with her since his parents weren't abusive. He realizes that her brother was the shardbearer he killed when he saved Amaram, but doesn't reveal that fact to her. She tells of her original plan to steal the Soulcaster from Jasnah, and becoming her ward and Adolin's betrothed instead. 

Shallan vanishes, and Kaladin realizes that he is having a vision. Kaladin sees a giant face and addresses it as Stormfather, and is called Child of Honor in return. Kal asks if Shallan is a Radiant and gets a rumble in return. Kal asks about Sylphrena and the Stormfather says that Kaladin killed her and that she can't be brought back since she is now broken.  He also declares that Kal will never ride his winds again, and then says goodbye as the vision ends. 
Shallan says she also saw the face of the vision, which Kal identifies as the Stormfather. After the storm subsides, they fall asleep.

'''Dalinar'''

Amaram implores Dalinar to speak with Sadeas and make peace with him before they begin their expedition. Dalinar looks at Navani but doesn't reply. They hear horns which announce the sighting of a chrysalis and its location, and Dalinar says they won't go after it on the way to the Parshendi camp. Amaram says that Sadeas will go after it on his own, and that his disobedience is causing the rifts in the kingdom to grow worse. Amaram says the Voidbringers are coming and they need to be united but Dalinar says the time and opportunity to work together with Sadeas has long past. Amaram tries to dissuade Dalinar from his expedition and says that even Dalinar won't listen to him anymore and why should anyone else, and Dalinar replies that he has to go out to seek the answers. Dalinar asks about Amaram's investigation into the madman, and Amaram says the madman was deluded about having a Shardblade. A messenger runs up, saying that Stormblessed has returned from the chasms.

Dalinar runs the entire way to the triage area where Kaladin is receiving medical attention, and Kaladin stands with great effort to salute him despite being told not to. Dalinar asks how he survived, and Kaladin says he is unsure but that spren were involved. Kaladin also indicates that he has brought Shallan safely back, and that he also killed a chasmfiend that had been prowling nearby, and presents its large glowing green gemheart to Dalinar. Shallan contradicts him and says the chasmfiend was already dead and rotting before they harvested it, and Kaladin confirms this story, but Dalinar suspects they are both lying. Navani appears and becomes protective of Shallan after her ordeal. Kaladin implores Dalinar to speak with Shallan of her discoveries before Dalinar leaves for his expedition. Dalinar tells Kaladin that bridge four held a vigil for him, with the confidence that he would return, and he asks if Kaladin has been the person that he was searching for. Kaladin replies that he once was but no longer is, and Dalinar grunts in response. He orders that any demands of Kaladin's are to be met as he is a hero, yet again. Dalinar wonders where Amaram went and decides to speak with Shallan.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan rests in bed, accepting Navani's unexpected affection. Pattern repeats a conversation he heard between Dalinar and Navani when he was sent to spy on them. Notably, Dalinar wants Shallan to go on the expedition but Navani tries to protect Shallan by having her stay behind. Shallan tells Pattern she has to go and asks if she is a Radiant. He replies most likely not yet since she has more to do first, but he isn't sure since he hasn't always been sentient. Pattern tells of the Recreance, when most spren except the Stormfather and a few others were killed (caused by broken oaths). Pattern thinks that the chance to learn is worth the possible cost of dying again. Pattern says that Shallan spoke the Words, but she lacks truth. Adolin appears and embraces her in a hug and kisses her. He says that he was visiting all the highprinces delivering an ultimatum to join Dalinar or be labeled as someone who refused to fulfill the Vengeance Pact. Shallan says she saw a dead chasm fiend that she wants to draw for him. Adolin apologizes for rescuing his father instead of her, and promises to protect her but she says that she doesn't need protecting and that she will never be 'something' to be locked away again, though she doesn't elaborate on when she was previously locked away. Dalinar and Navani enter. Dalinar has a request, but Shallan, anticipating it, asks to go on the expedition despite the dangers since she thinks the ancient city that Jasnah was searching for is there. Dalinar asks her to expand on their map of the Shattered Plains and she agrees. Shallan also requests that they leave the parshmen behind since Jasnah felt they were dangerous. Dalinar says that he will do so, and that they are leaving within the hour.

Pai, a devout female ardent, is assigned to be mentored by Brother Lhan in Kholinar so that she can join Queen Aesudan's retinue as she requests. Lhan explains that the ardents are rewarded well by the Queen as long as they make her feel that she is religiously devout, though Pai feels that the Queen lives too luxuriously while there are starving Alethi. Lhan feels that he has to persuade Pai to be less confrontational and more accepting of the Queen's lack of religious orthodoxy. Lhan tries to explain how comfortable Pai's life will be but this seems to only make Pai more disagreeable. Lhan then shows Pai some wasted rotting food, and tries to convince her that if she is allowed to stay that she will be able to have a positive effect in the city by being given an opportunity to help the poor, but that she won't be allowed to stay if she maintains a contrary position to the lazy lives of the Queen's ardents. After given several hours to think, Pai questions Lhan about the lack of spirituality in Alethkar, and about how the elite only go through the motions but aren't really devout. Pai says that she will comply with his request to fit in with the ardent's lazy lifestyle and lead by example and do what good she could, though Lhan isn't entirely confident that she won't cause trouble.

Lhan arrives at the palace the next day to find that Pai has painted the throne room with large glyphs depicting the ten foolish attributes, and how the Queen exemplifies them. Pai is subsequently executed, and the Alethi riot in protest of this.

Taravangian awakes on a ship with stiff muscles, noting that he doesn't feel stupid, which he considers a good sign. He notices that his ship has moored on time when his servants arrive. [[Maben]] brings him his morning meal, but is stopped by [[Mrall]], one of the Kings testers. He wants Taravangian to take the test first since it is an important day and he wants to know what to expect. Taravangian agrees with him and Mrall lets the testers approach. The three [[stormwarden]]s give the King some paper on which some math-problems are put down with figures and [[glyph]]s. Taravangian made these himself on one of his better days and even though he knows he is not a complete idiot, he finds that he is only average on this day. After checking the papers, the stomwardens judge: "He is fit to serve," one proclaimed. "He may not change the Diagram, but he may interact outside of supervision, may change policy, and pass judgment." Mrall, after getting Taravangian's acceptance, lets Maban bring him his breakfast. Taravangian considers that, even though it always takes up one hour of every day, the test is the best way for a man who wakes up every morning with a different level of intelligence. He contemplates that life can be tricky especially when the world might depend on him.

Taravangian and his retinue enter the battlefield outside [[Vedenar]], where his countrymen setup healing tents to tend to the wounded, and where they are welcomed and cheered for their mercy and aid, as the Diagram predicted, despite the fact that he was behind the civil war. Taravangian and Adrotagia speculate on the Thrill and Nergaoul. As Taravangian talks to the soldiers to show his compassion, he is confronted by Szeth who says they need to speak. Taravangian panics and makes sure he still has the Oathstone. They talk quietly and Szeth says that there is a problem, that Dalinar has a Surgebinder. Taravangian thinks Szeth found out about Jasnah and thinks she faked her own death. Szeth says that he fought a male Surgebinder who protected Dalinar, which surprises Taravangian and makes him wonder how Szeth will deal with the fact that he was right about the Voidbringers returning. Taravangian says that Szeth must have fought someone who had an honorblade, and that he must return to kill Dalinar and avoid fighting Kaladin.

Taravangian's cabal discuss the possible identity of the Surgebinder. He consults the Diagram, and tells Adro that he asked the Nightwatcher for Capacity to save humankind from the desolations. Taravangian guesses from one of the passages that one of the bridgemen that Dalinar took is the Surgebinder, and that they must keep Szeth from him at all costs, to maintain control of their assassin.

Taravangian then goes to see King Valam, who is dying. Valam is upset at how coy Taravangian is. He knows that Taravangian is feigning neutrality, but will soon press his valid but hidden claim for the throne of Jah Keved once Valam dies. Valam tells his scribe that he is making Taravangian his heir, and is shocked to learn all the other highprinces are dead. Valam asks his son Redin to stab him in the heart to put him out of his misery. He does so when prodded, and as Valam dies, he has a death rattle. Taravangian thinks he has succeeded as the Diagram instructed him, to become king of Jah Keved, that it is unifying the world as Gavilar insisted was necessary based on visions that he had.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin has insomnia and worries that he killed Sylphrena. He leaves his bed and tells Lopen that he wants to watch the army depart. Lopen asks why he doesn't use Stormlight to heal and he says he lost his ability and that Syl is gone, and Lopen tries to give him advice to get Syl to return. Kaladin gasps in awe and tells Lopen that the gathered armies appeared as Kaladin had imagined them to be when he was younger. Kal and Lopen go to see bridge four off on the expedition.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar expresses surprise to Roion that Sebarial is bringing his army. Dalinar says as much to Sebarial who replies that he thinks there are opportunities for him out on the Plains and he wants to be thought of as arriving before Highprince Aladar joined them, further surprising Dalinar.

'''Sadeas'''

Ialai tells Sadeas they could try seizing power in a coup, as they scout Sebarial's farms west of the warcamps. Sadeas says it won't be necessary and that Dalinar won't survive the expedition. A messenger arrives and delivers unpleasant news.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar questions why Aladar is joining them since he was always a supporter of Sadeas, and he replies that he won't stand by while two of the least brave highprinces march to war to fulfill the Vengeance Pact. Dalinar demands a vow of loyalty from Aladar, and decides that he will trust him out of necessity though he will make sure that he is not in a position to be betrayed again. Amaram questions Dalinar's decision to trust Sebarial and Aladar, and mentions the glory they could have by leaving them out, and Dalinar says that he hopes they are above that. As they ride, Dalinar sees Kaladin and bridge four, and tells Amaram to come with him to speak to them to put the rumors of what Kaladin said about
Amaram behind them.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin feels jealous of Adolin over Shallan, but his admiration for Adolin overcomes that and he thinks they belong together. Kaladin thinks that he should talk to Renarin about his condition and find out if anything else is going on. The bridgemen all berate Kaladin for not recuperating from his injuries. Dalinar and Amaram appear, and Kaladin suppresses his hatred after the punishment that he had to endure after his challenge was turned down. Kaladin asks who is watching Elhokar, and Teft says they left their best man, and Kaladin realizes that would be Moash, and silently curses to himself. Dalinar asks Amaram to confirm his story that he never met Kaladin before and that he didn't steal his shards from Kaladin. Amaram concurs with these statements, saying that Kal's claims are preposterous. Dalinar says an apology is in order, and interrupts Kaladin and looks at Amaram, who is shocked. Dalinar explains his sting operation with Bordin and Taln to trick Amaram, then summons a Shardblade and holds it to Amaram's throat right before Amaram summons his own. Dalinar demands an explanation for Amaram's lies and deceit, and Amaram says that he did it for the greater good since the Voidbringers are returning. Amaram apologizes to Kaladin, who realizes with shock that Amaram is sincere despite the means that he used to achieve his goals. Dalinar accuses Amaram of murder, but Amaram counters that Dalinar has sent many soldiers to death to win gemhearts. Dalinar tells Amaram to remove his cloak since he is no Radiant, and lets him go for now against Kal's protests, and says that he will face justice at a later time. Kaladin thanks Dalinar for believing him, and Dalinar tells him to get rest. Kaladin tells Dalinar to stay safe, and Dalinar replies that him having a Shardblade, though it feels wrong, will help him if Szeth shows up.

'''Sadeas'''

Sadeas is upset that Aladar is joining Dalinar, and makes plans to replace the highprinces that he thinks will die on the expedition.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan is excited as the armies begin their march across the Plains. She and Adolin banter as they ride. Shallan is briefly distracted by thoughts of Kaladin. Adolin suggests that Shallan ride in Sebarial's carriage and she says that if she could walk through a highstorm then she can ride, but he warns her of saddle soreness which is a hazard of riding. Gaz appears and delivers a copy of Words of Radiance as she requested and she thanks him.

Shallan rides in a private coach with Pattern, reading her new book, which tells of the orders of the Knights Radiant and their traditions, abilities, and attitudes, though some of it is based on hearsay since it was written two hundred years after the Recreance. Shallan wonders about the different Orders, and if Surgebinders would start appearing. Navani joins her in her coach and apologizes for neglecting Shallan and asks to help with her research. The two bond over their shared feelings of inadequacy around Jasnah. They discuss plans to narrow down where Stormseat is located and how to open the Oathgate. Shallan says that Jasnah expected Urithiru to have information about the Knights Radiant and Voidbringers, and Navani replies that she was, like Dalinar, trying to bring back powers that should be left alone. Shallan reveals that Jasnah actually succeeded and that Jasnah could soulcast on her own without a Soulcaster, and that her fabrial was a fake. Navani is alarmed by this since the Radiants are linked to the return of the Voidbringers, and leaves to make preparations.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin feels gloomy as he is stuck in a sickbed during the dreary Weeping period. Moash visits Kal and explains the plan to kill Elhokar and make Dalinar the new king, and that Kaladin won't need to do anything. Kal tells him that he lost his abilities and that he thinks Syl left him because of the assassination plot. Moash says he visited to deliver a message from Elhokar for Kaladin to visit the drunk king, but will tell Elhokar that Kaladin isn't up for it. He leaves after making sure Kaladin isn't having second thoughts about the planned assassination. Kaladin feels helpless at this point to stop the plot, being wounded and powerless.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishatev 1173''

Shallan draws a sketch of Jasnah based on a memory of her on the ''Wind's Pleasure''. Pattern sees some creationspren fade out and comments how useless they are. They discuss the nature of perception and lies, the latter a subject that fascinates Pattern.

Dalinar joins Shallan in her tent and she takes a memory since she has no sketches of him. Dalinar asks for privacy, and Shallan's guard and the scribes leave. Dalinar asks about what she had told him about Jasnah discovering the secrets of the Radiants and she verifies what she said is true. Dalinar says he thinks he is supposed to refound the Knights, but that he chose the wrong person to lead them, and that they might be refounding themselves. Shallan asks Dalinar if he is supposed to gather the Radiants instead of refounding them, then she demonstrates her ability which leaves Dalinar in awe. Dalinar says he should put Shallan in charge of the Radiants but she demurs, using an awkward phrase, but they are then interrupted by an alert of Parshendi being spotted. Dalinar goes to investigate and Shallan follows, assuring him that she can handle the danger. She says that she can also soulcast but not well, and asks her abilities to be kept a secret and he says he will only tell Navani but she says not to, and that she isn't really under his authority. Dalinar acquiesces to her demands but says they will talk further and that she gives him hope. A scout reports that they spotted the Parshendi and lost three men but killed one of the foes. They appear different from past Parshendi, and the scouts had burn wounds oddly enough, despite the rain. Shallan examines the corpse and sees that its eyes are red and is alarmed by it. Teleb reports that another Parshendi walked up to the army, not attacking but just standing, and Dalinar and Shallan go to investigate. The Parshman, Rlain, calls out to some of the bridgemen. Skar verifies that he used to be in Bridge Four and now wants to surrender to Dalinar.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishatah 1173''
Dalinar and Navani interrogate Rlain in his tent. Dalinar notices how much different he appears from regular parshmen. Rlain salutes Dalinar and sits as instructed. Rlain doesn't know any of the Parshendi plans and says he was a parshman spy for about three years. Rlain says that something is wrong and that Eshonai has changed in a bad way. All his friends among the listeners have become monsters, and that he has nothing left. Skar and Rock disagree and say Rlain is still a member of Bridge Four. Rlain tells them that although he is a Parshendi, he was able to spy on the Alethi because he changed into dullform to closely impersonate a parshman and that no one would suspect or complain about having an extra parshman slave. Dalinar asks about the red eyes and Rlain replies that it means their gods have returned; the souls of those ancient who hate the Alethi want to bring something terrible. Dalinar tells Rlain to lead the Alethi army to Rlain's people and that Dalinar will protect the innocent and non-combantants and try to save them from destruction. Rlain is released into the custody of Bridge Four.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishishach 1173''

'''Shallan'''

Shallan climbs up a rock formation to get a good view of the ruins of an old city. Shallan reluctantly returns to the tents to join a war council among the highprinces. Shallan tells Dalinar they must push onward. Adolin reports that ten thousand Parshendi have been spotted on the nearby plateaus. Dalinar decides they will march toward the city the next day and attack.

Everyone leaves but Dalinar, Navani and Shallan. Shallan tells the two that the Oathgate is real according to Jasnah, and Dalinar thinks they might need it in case of emergency to escape.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin walks through the near deserted camp to think and try to put his losses behind him. He returns to his barracks and finds Elhokar is waiting for him. Elhokar speaks with Kal privately and asks how Kaladin knows how to be a hero. Elhokar complains that he is incompetent even though the Almighty gave him the throne. Elhokar asks Kal if he is a bad king, and Kal replies yes. Kal thinks he could kill the king then and there and wonders if he should, but then realizes that while it would be good for the people, he doesn't want to fail Dalinar. Kaladin suggests that Elhokar resign, which angers the king. Elhokar then says that when Kaladin came, that the shadows that haunted him vanished and that there is something special about Kaladin. Elhokar apologizes for his previous treatment and imprisonment of Kaladin which was out of jealousy, and admits culpability for their failure to deal with Sadeas, and leaves.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishishach 1173''

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar goes to the edge of a plateau and looks across a chasm to see a large group of Parshendi with glowing red eyes. Dalinar calms down the other highprinces and gives orders for the army to be prepared for battle. Navani says she can't hide from danger since she has to setup her fabrials. Dalinar gives a motivational speech to nearby soldiers saying that he was sent from the Almighty with knowledge of what they face from visions of the past and to trust that the Voidbringers will be countered by the Radiants as in the past. As they wait to join the battle, the Parshendi start singing. Rlain appears as summoned and says that song is of death and destruction and power. The Parshendi start glowing, and Rlain tells Dalinar that they must stop the song or else. Heeding the countdown that says this is the last day that it was leading to, Dalinar orders that his army attack immediately.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin walks through the lighteyes training ground, still injured and walking with a crutch. Kal talks with Zahel who says the Purelake reminds him of his home unlike the Shattered Plains. Zahel says they flooded the training grounds to wash the sand with the Weeping rains. Kal says he is looking for Wit but Zahel says he isn't around. Kal explains his dilemma vaguely and Zahel replies to choose the option that lets him sleep best at night. Kal tries to practice his spear forms but has difficulty due to his injury. Kal has a realization that Elhokar is Dalinar's Tien.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin receives his orders to attack and orders his soldiers to be ready to charge against the Parshendi. After receiving the signal, his group charges, but they get hit by a lightning blast which kills [[Sureblood]] and throws Adolin from the saddle, dazing him briefly. Adolin sees flashes of red lightning taking out his soldiers. He yells at his men to advance as if they were fighting archers. He is struck directly by a bolt of lightning but it only blinds him momentarily. He suspects his Shardplate and helm provide some sort of immunity or protection to the Parshendi lightning attacks. He subsequently uses his Shardblade to attack and kill some Parshendi, and he sees small red spren leave the corpses and vanish.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan sketches a map of the nearby plateaus so they can try to locate the Oathgate, as a scout reports on the local terrain and Parshendi locations. Pattern says something is very bad. Inadara implies that Pattern is related to the Voidbringers and Pattern replies that she is more likely to be one, causing her to be annoyed. Renarin studies Pattern closely. Pattern says the red stormspren are a form of voidspren that present a great danger. Another scout arrives and says that Shallan's drawing of the central plateau is wrong and that it is actually round, not thin and long, and this alarms Shallan.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar orders Renarin to find some soldiers to accompany Shallan, and to lead them. He sees that the fighting is tough but his men are holding against the wind and lightning attacks. Dalinar redeploys his soldiers and orders Navani's fabrials to be used. As he walks, he hears a voice and realizes it is the same one he has heard in his visions.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin returns to the palace to save Elhokar, and notices there are no guards which alarms him. He reaches Elhokar's rooms and sees two unfamiliar men, who work for Graves. They tell Kaladin that everything is taken care of and to return to his barracks. With effort, Kal ambushes and incapacitates them. He enters the room and finds the king lying down on a couch and not moving.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin battles but the Parshendi try to ensnare him using ropes. Perel reports that both forces are currently evenly matched, and that the singing Parshendi are not joining the battle. Adolin decides to go after the singers and has a battalion gathered to go after them while Perel provides a distraction.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar addresses the voice he hears, but the voice says it is not the Almighty, but rather a [[sliver]] of Him left after He was killed by Odium. A messenger reports that Teleb has fallen and Roion routed. Dalinar takes the messenger's horse and goes to the battlefront to get a firsthand look at the status. He goes to Navani and tells her to execute her plan immediately. A line of archers under a covered pavilion is exposed to the chasm front, with fabrials draining moisture from the air, and the archers join the battle to attack the Parshendi who are surrounding Roion's forces.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin relaxes as Elhokar is alive but drunk, and the king sulks. Kaladin warns that assassins are coming and they must seek safety. As they leave, one of Grave's men surprises and stabs Elhokar in the side, before Kal can stab him with his spear. The king is bleeding though not critically injured. Kal tells Elhokar to put pressure on his wound, and the king sees that Kal is also bleeding. Kal tells Elhokar not to give up as they flee. Moash and Graves, both in Shardplate, appear.

;Plot Summary
:''Ishishach 1173''

'''Shallan'''

Shallan and Renarin along with some soldiers and bridgemen enter a deserted circular plateau after skirting along the battle lines. She explains that this must be where the Oathgate is because it seems to be the center from which the Shattered Plains was broken. Pattern says the Voidspren are raising a storm, and Renarin says the winds are blowing the wrong way, from west to east, and that is an Everstorm. Shallan tells them to search the area for anything out of the ordinary. They find a large rock mound and Renarin cuts a hole into it at Shallan's request.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin and his soldiers enter a chamber in the rock formation behind the Parshendi lines, after Adolin cut a hole in the rock using his Shardblade. Adolin tells his force that he will cut a hole in the wall behind their foes and that they are to attack the singing Parshendi who are on the other side of the wall. Adolin's group is able to ambush the singers who are disoriented briefly when they stop singing to fight back. Adolin is disgusted by the ease with which he kills his foes, instead of feeling the 'Thrill' as usual. He dismisses his Shardblade but is then attacked by Eshonai and he then happily resummons his blade in order to face the worthy foe.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar retreats from the battle to get a spear wound treated by physicians. The survivors of Roion's army follow him. Navani shows up and Dalinar tells her they are losing the battle, though Navani says that Adolin won his plateau. Roion yells in panic that they are losing, and Dalinar hears the voice that says it should not end this way. Dalinar asks who the voice is and realizes the voice is the Stormfather, who calls Dalinar a child of Honor. The Stormfather says he is both spren and god and that the Parshendi are summoning an opposing deadly storm and that all he can do is bring a storm of cleansing to wash away their bodies. Dalinar is angered and denounces the Stormfather for abandoning them. The Stormfather says he has to go since his daughter is disobeying and that Dalinar will see no more visions. Dalinar pleads for him to not leave.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin stands before Elhokar's unconscious body as Moash approaches. Graves yells at Moash who in turn replies that Kaladin is indeed trustworthy. Kal recognizes that they are in the same hallway as where Szeth previously attacked. Moash tries to get Kal to stand down, saying the king is probably already dead, but Kal refuses and says that Moash is betraying bridge four, and that Kal is trying to repent by doing the right thing now. Moash and Kaladin argue and Kaladin tries to get Moash to pursue justice against Roshone who was responsible for the death of Moash's grandparents, and that Moash's method is not honorable. Kal refuses to back down and Moash readies to fight.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan and Renarin enter a large circular room covered with majestic images on the wall and floor. She believes that this is where the portal is. There are ten equal divisions in the floor mural and an eleventh narrower one representing Urithiru. Renarin says it is coming. Pattern says the Everstorm has been summoned and that there is another highstorm and that the two will collide nearby, causing a very devastating storm. Shallan tells Renarin to insert his Shardblade into a keyhole to try to activate the gate but nothing happens. Shallan tells the bridgemen to get their armies onto this plateau so that they can escape, while the scholars try to figure out how to work the Oathgate.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin and Eshonai duel amidst the storm and battle. Eshonai thinks she is winning, but she gets reckless and Adolin is able to knock her into a chasm by slamming into her chest and knocking her backward. Adolin almost falls but is grabbed by Skar and Drehy and other soldiers who pull Adolin back away from the chasm ledge. Adolin returns to the central plateau to get an update and stops someone who looks like a cloaked messenger but it turns out to be Szeth.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin tries to attack with his spear, but Moash breaks it then hits him hard with a shard-aided punch, and Kaladin crumbles in pain with broken ribs. Moash and Graves try to set the scene up to implicate Szeth as Elhokar's assassin. Kaladin hears a distant argument between Sylphrena and the Stormfather. Moash and Graves argue over which one of them will kill Elhokar. Kaladin thinks that he will protect even those he hates so long as it's right, his next oath, and explains it to himself why he must do so since that is what is right. Kaladin struggles to stand up and draws his knife and places himself between the assassins and Elhokar. Kaladin stands in defiance and hears Syl claim him and stand down the Stormfather's argument. Graves says that Kaladin must die, and Kaladin drops his knife. Kaladin speaks his third oath as instructed to do by Sylphrena and the Stormfather accepts the words. Syl appears and tells Kaladin to hold his hand out, and she becomes a Shardblade in his hand. Kaladin breathes in and drains the Stormlight from all the nearby spheres, exploding with light and blinding Moash as he heals himself. Wind blows in through burst shutters and a glyph resembling wings forms in frost on the ground. Kaladin says the Knights Radiant have returned, and Graves yells out that the Diagram spoke of this but that they didn't realize what it referred to until it was too late, saying they were trying to separate Kal from Dalinar but not realizing the implications. Moash and Graves flee. Kaladin puzzles over Graves' words, realizing that Dalinar is in danger, and Syl tells him something is still very wrong.

'''Dalinar'''

Peet reports to Dalinar and Navani that Shallan said there were two storms converging on their location. Cael reports that Aladar won his plateau and that they were defeating the Parshendi. They plan to relocate to where Shallan is to try to flee to safety. Adolin suddenly flies into the tent, battered and missing parts of his Shardplate. Szeth arrives nearby as Dalinar looks up.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan tries to figure out the puzzle of opening the Oathgate. Renarin speaks cryptically about seeing the future and that the end has come.

'''Dalinar'''

Fearing the end as Szeth approaches, Dalinar speaks to Adolin about being a good leader when Adolin ultimately takes over their princedom. Dalinar tells Adolin that he was taught well and is a good man and that Adolin isn't a tyrant like Dalinar originally was, and to unite the highprinces. Dalinar tells bridge four to back off, and asks Szeth why he killed Gavilar. Szeth replies that he obeys his masters without explanation and that he will get what he is owed. Szeth attacks and is parried by Dalinar, causing Szeth to smile wickedly.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin struggles to his feet, watching Dalinar and Szeth battle and seeing another storm forming. He tells Skar and Drehy to help him remove his battered (non-functioning) Shardplate.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar thinks of his brother as he fights Szeth. Eventually Szeth gets a Stormlight aided punch through and breaks Dalinar's ribs, taking him out of the fight. Dalinar comes to the realization that he would not have been able to save his brother's life against Szeth, bringing peace to his soul. Szeth approaches to finish the fight, but is attacked by Roion.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin watches as Szeth slices up Roion's sword and lashes him to the sky, causing him to fly up. Szeth then slays a dozen soldiers easily. Adolin attacks but is easily parried. Roion soon comes crashing down to the earth and is instantly killed from the impact. Adolin is joined by some bridgemen and soldiers, but Szeth manages to knock him back with a forceful swing of his Shardblade. Szeth reaches Dalinar and touches him, causing him to fly up into the sky (in the same manner as Roion), then walks away. Adolin follows but stops as Szeth says that he is done. Adolin moves to strike at Szeth but the parrying blow breaks his wrist and Szeth moves in for the kill as Adolin loses his blade. He looks up in surprise to see Dalinar floating back down slowly. Szeth looks up in horror to see Kaladin crash into the ground holding a Shardblade, leaving a swordlike glyph where he landed. Kaladin says that he claims the sky and winds, and Szeth's life.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin watches as Szeth reacts in horror to his arrival and Dalinar's safe landing. Kal tells Dalinar to seek shelter as he flew over a storm while traveling. Kaladin says he will deal with Szeth and says 'yes' when Dalinar asks if Kal is what Dalinar has been looking for. Teft and bridge four members throw down lanterns with infused gems for Kaladin to drain for investiture. Kaladin attacks Szeth, angered and ready to avenge the fallen bridgemen.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan asks to have Renarin quieted while she tries to figure out the pattern to opening the Oathgate and realizes that the lock is a fabrial.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar asks for a status report on their retreat as he watches Kaladin fight Szeth. He helps Adolin to his feet and confirms that Kaladin is a Radiant, making Adolin smile in realization. Adolin heads toward where Shallan is, along with some bridgemen. Dalinar finds his horse, then goes toward Shallan's plateau, finding Roion's army heading that way. Dalinar encounters Sebarial, who is in repose with Palona, and who says that he helped organize the retreat, and gives an update on the armies. Aladar reports on his victory and proclaims the Vengeance Pact fulfilled due to the overwhelming number of Parshendi slain, as the soldiers gather on one plateau. Dalinar explains that victory feels like exhaustion and pain and suffering, and that they need to fit everyone close together on the plateau to be ready to get through the portal.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin flies through the air chasing Szeth as Syl flies around him, saying that she was only as dead as his oaths. Kaladin asks about the out of season highstorm, and Syl says the Stormfather caused it to try to end it all and wash everyone away and hide from the future. Kaladin flies high enough to break the storm ceiling into sunlight and finds Szeth. Szeth claims that Kaladin stole an honorblade  but he denies this. Szeth attacks and Syl changes into a spear so that Kaladin can more easily parry. Szeth observes this but clings to his denial of Kaladin being a Radiant.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan infuses spheres in the chamber with Stormlight, not bothering to conceal her abilities. She runs out of Stormlight and cries for more gemstones. She sees Adolin leading the soldiers and goes to him briefly. Adolin sees her glowing and says, 'you too?' and she replies 'yes, sorry' then yells for them to hurry.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin and Szeth battle, using Lashings to maneuver back and forth as the two storms crash into each other below. Szeth says the Knights can't be back but Kal retorts that they are and will kill him. Szeth manages to stab Kaladin but he is able to heal his wound though it consumes a lot of Stormlight. Szeth boasts that he will win due to his experience but Kal says that the sky is and was always his. Kal starts fighting instinctually and manages to strike Szeth as Syl changes weapon forms (e.g., sword to spear to hammer to spear, etc.) while they fight, though Szeth dodges a killing blow. Kaladin sees the top of the plateau crest through the clouds, spinning slowly. Szeth lands on the surface, chased by Kaladin. Szeth again yells that the Voidbringers can't be back, and heads back toward where Dalinar is in order to complete his assigned assassination.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan gets the last spheres lit as time is running out, and the floor begins to glow. Shallan tells Adolin to put his Shardblade into the keyhole but nothing happens. She realizes what the problem is, and summons Pattern in blade form, and puts him in the key hole, causing a reaction as she senses something unlock deep inside the plateau. Shallan and Adolin push against Pattern (in the form of an inserted blade/lever) along a ridge in the circular wall to where the picture of Urithiru is, and she then pulls Pattern out. The lamps then fade out.

'''Kaladin'''

Kal follows Szeth into the storm as Syl admonishes caution because the Stormfather hates him and this is his domain and that another worse storm brews as well. Kaladin and Szeth both reinvest their Stormlight from the storm. Szeth reaches the plateau before Kaladin but it is mysteriously empty.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin cuts a hole in the stone, revealing sunlight. They look outside and find the gathered armies on the plateau, but it has relocated to the mountain range that also houses Urithiru.

'''Kaladin'''

Szeth screams at Kaladin as red spren zip around in the tempest. Szeth realizes that Dalinar and the armies went to Urithiru, and flies off toward the west, chased by Kal. Kaladin chases with difficulty and they both reach the stormfront and break through it, and Kaladin stabs Szeth in his foot. Kaladin manages to smash Szeth in his shoulder as they fight just ahead of the highstorm. As they fight, Szeth finally acknowledges the truth and says that he was right all along and never Truthless, and that he could have stopped murdering at any time. Szeth stops fighting, and Kaladin is about to make a killing strike, but instead slices his wrist, sending the Honorblade tumbling down. Syl urges Kaladin to grab the sword, and Kaladin dives after it as Szeth falls to the ground, no longer lashed and pummeled by the storm.{{bws ref|three-stories-in-new-formats|Three Stories in New Formats|date=2015-03-06}}{{ref|text=In the original release of ''Words of Radiance'', Kaladin severed Szeth's spine with his Shardblade, killing Szeth. Brandon decided to change this in subsequent releases.}} Kaladin stays hovering surrounded by windspren, and Syl says she may keep Kaladin around. Syl demands compliments and a smile.

;Plot summary

'''Kaladin'''

Sylphrena says that the other storm which is blowing from west to east is of Him, not us, but that she doesn't know what will happen. Kaladin wonders where the army vanished to as he stands on the empty plateau where the army had been. Syl verifies that Shardblades are dead spren, but they gain a little life when summoned, and that forces, unlike people, can be broken without being completely destroyed. Kaladin asks why Szeth's blade doesn't scream and Syl says it is not a spren but something different and dangerous. She says she thinks it is an Honorblade of the Heralds, and that its grants its holder the powers of a Windrunner, and that the Honorblades were given by Honor to men and that spren are based on those blades, and that it is valuable. She explains that the blade gives the abilities without the checks a spren requires but that it requires dangerous amounts of Stormlight. Kaladin encounters some men from bridge four, including Rock and Teft. Kaladin says the new blade was Szeth's and he is now dead. Bisig says that Radiant girl showed them how to bring the plateau back, and Kaladin realizes that must be Shallan and that she is either a Radiant or has an Honorblade. Kaladin gets a status report, and wonders what he should say about Moash, and realizes he can't keep his abilities a secret. Teft says some of the bridgemen began to glow and that the bridgemen might be part of the Radiants' hierarchy as well. Teft tells Kaladin that his eyes turned light and Kaladin silently curses. Kal summons Syl to operate the lock fabrial to transport them.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan stands by the gates of Urithiru, watching as people begin exploring the city. Pattern says that Shallan is almost a Radiant and will be so once she speaks truths. Shallan guesses that their location is in the mountains near Tu Bayla or perhaps Emul. Shallan checks in with Dalinar as scribes send messages via spanreed warning of the storm blowing in the wrong direction. Dalinar reports that Elhokar vanished and that Kholinar is in riot. Shallan sees a flash that marks the return of Kaladin and bridge four. Kaladin floats over, carrying a Shardblade, and reports that Szeth is dead and that Elhokar was wounded but relocated to a safe house that no one would think of.

'''Lopen'''

Lopen experiments with an infused gemstone as his mother implores Elhokar to eat his chouta. Chilinko tells Lopen they may need to move from their house in Sebarial's warcamp as there is word that something was found on the Plains. Lopen manages to drain some Stormlight briefly and sees new flesh growing where his arm is missing, and he then demands more spheres from his family, proclaiming in triumph.

'''Moash'''

Moash rides on a cart heading out of the warcamps, with his armor packed away. Graves joins him and points out some scavengers going through the warcamps to loot them. He says they will get what is coming to them when the Everstorm arrives. Moash thinks to himself in disbelief that he was a traitor and that he tried to kill Kaladin and failed to kill Elhokar. Graves explains what he knows from the Diagram though it is vague, and curses that Jasnah was right about the Voidbringers being the Parshmen. Moash asks who Graves really is, and he replies that he is a patriot who interpreted the Diagram incorrectly. Graves tells Moash that he will bring him into the Diagram and that they have important work ahead in saving the world. Moash thinks he was played but still goes along.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

Shallan explores the main tower of Urithiru, though she is tired. As she wanders, she finds a folded piece of paper marked with the Ghostblood symbol and her real name, which alarms her. She enters a nearby room where Mraize awaits her, and readies to draw Pattern just in case, acknowledging to herself that Pattern is not a typical blade. Mraize says that she gave herself away by using her abilities while saving the army, and suggests that Veil is her true identity, not Shallan. Mraize speculates on how people will see Shallan, and says that the Ghostbloods take care of their own including her. She angrily declares that the Ghostbloods killed Jasnah, but Mraize calmly replies that Jasnah had assassinated some of their members also, and that he should have guessed Shallan's identity sooner due to her family's history. Shallan says she won't help Mraize but he replies that he has her brothers. He also says that he is owed for the broken Soulcaster and that she happens to be one. Shallan threatens to kill Mraize but he says that her brothers will be safe, and then he says that there are answers that she needs to learn about the Ghostbloods' purpose and what her brother and father were up to. He says that she can be both a Radiant and a Ghostblood in her different identities and that she can take time to consider if she wants to join the Ghostbloods.

She finds Adolin and they hug and banter for a bit. Adolin leaves after saying that Pattern chose her quarters for her. She looks at the wall which resembles the room at her father's home and Pattern says it is time for her to be a Radiant. She sees an illusion of a room with a white carpet and two corpses on the floor, and a painting outlined with a glow with something hidden behind it. Behind the painting, a strongbox is hidden and she opens it and takes out a Shardblade that was originally Pattern. Shallan looks at the corpses of her mother and her mother's friend and talks about how her mother tried to kill Shallan when she learned what Shallan could do. Shallan speaks of how her father took the blame for Shallan killing her own mother in self-defense and how it destroyed their family and that Pattern says that Shallan will get revenge and kill Pattern. Shallan says she doesn't want revenge, she wants her family.

'''Amaram'''

Amaram writes a note to Restares reporting that Voidbringers were spotted and that a new storm was unleashed, and that the world had to be put in crisis for the Heralds and Church to return to dominance. He gives the note to Pama to be sent to Restares. As he walks through Dalinar's temple complex he reflects that the Sons of Honor achieved their goal and that Gavilar would be proud. Amaram stealthily cuts his way into the room where Taln is being held, thinking of regrets for his loss of friendship with Dalinar over Kaladin's accusations of murder. As Amaram leads Taln from the room, Taln catches a poison dart in midair that would have hit Amaram, and he sees a masked person shoot another dart at him that is also caught before the would-be assassin runs away. Amaram then leads Taln to his coach.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth wakes up wondering why he did not die from the Shardblade wound. Nale is standing there and Szeth recognizes him. Nale explains how he was brought back to life, and says he is one of Szeth's gods, though Szeth replies that his gods are the stones, sun and stars, not men. Szeth recognizes him as Nalan, Herald of Justice. Szeth asks why he was saved since he can't take his torment anymore and Nale replies those words are foolish and unbecoming of his apprentice to be. Szeth says he wants to die, but then changes his mind and says that he was right and his people wrong. Nale says he will teach him to ignore feelings and bring justice to his former leaders. Szeth says he is not worthy but Nale disagrees saying that he stuck to his personal code at great cost and is worthy to be a Skybreaker. Nale says that Szeth is reborn and is to begin training immediately and that he brought a Shardblade for Szeth and throws it to the ground. Szeth picks up the odd sheathed black Shardblade with a trail of smoke, and hears a voice say "Hello, would you like to destroy some evil today?"

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar dreams of his youthful home, and a distant source of warmth, then wakes up in Urithiru. He thinks the dream was a vision but there was no highstorm which generally accompanies the visions he has.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin walks through the city, exploring, wondering at how the tables have turned in his relationship to Shallan with her newfound importance as a Radiant. Adolin runs into Sadeas scouting the city, and tries to get Sadeas to admit that Dalinar was right, but Sadeas claims it was all a deal worked out with the Parshendi as evidenced by Rlain being a bridgeman. Adolin asks why Sadeas wants to knowingly spread lies, and Sadeas says that either him or Dalinar can succeed but not both. Sadeas says that he suffered a temporary setback but will take everything away from Dalinar, and this aggravates Adolin into attacking Sadeas. They grapple, and eventually Adolin stabs Sadeas in the skull, killing him. He throws away Sadeas' Shardblade and covers up his tracks and leaves.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar reaches the roof of the central tower. He looks down upon the city, seeing the circular rings that comprise the tower, and pillars that match one in the capital of Alethkar where the palace and temple were built. Dalinar then looks up and questions the actions of the Stormfather that almost led to their destruction. The Stormfather explains his purpose and that he is like a spren to the Almighty. Dalinar swears the First and Second Ideals of the Order of Bondsmiths, and the Stormfather reluctantly bonds him, though he insists upon Dalinar getting rid of his Shardblade and refuses to be summoned as one. The Stormfather says that he sent no vision that morning and states that Dalinars experience was a simple dream, which confuses Dalinar, as he felt it was even stronger than a vision. The Stormfather bids Dalinar to go and lead his people against Odium, warning that he is leading them to destruction as Dalinar is nothing compared to the Almighty. Dalinar retorts that if the Almighty could be killed, then so can Odium. Dalinar leaves the tower top and goes to another room near the top where Shallan and Kaladin await. Dalinar takes out a sphere and draws Stormlight into himself in response to Kaladin's inquiry, and feels his injuries heal.

Dalinar explains that he is a Bondsmith and Shallan says there are three knights but is corrected by Renarin, who walks in and reveals himself to be a Truthwatcher. Dalinar explains that the Parshmen are all being changed by the Everstorm and that they must prepare. Kaladin says he has to go home to warn his parents, leaves with Dalinar's blessing to pack for the journey. Dalinar sends Renarin to Elhokar (who has arrived with the Herdazians with whom he was hiding) to acquire spheres for Kaladin; he muses that now Renarin is a Radiant, he should stop sending him on menial errands. Dalinar and Shallan, now alone, speak of the tasks facing them to save as many people as possible, reciting the First Ideal again.
