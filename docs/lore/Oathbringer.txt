;Plot Summary
:''Six years ago''
[[Eshonai]] arrives at the docks of [[Kholinar]] and marvels at its beauty and size. She talks to [[Gitgeth]] about the [[Parshman]] slaves, whom he calls "rhythmless ones." They are only capable of trying to help and cannot even comprehend the invitation to join the celebration. Eshonai wanders off toward the palace and begins exploring. She peeks into a doorway and sees King [[Gavilar]]. [[Amaram]] comes out and says that the king would like to speak to her. Gavilar dismisses the others in the room and he invites her to sit down. He shows her a [[fabrial]] and explains that they work by trapping [[spren]] in a gemheart. She is awed that the humans have made devices that mimic how they apply the forms. He believes that the world is stuck in a rut and needs a major conflict to progress. Eshonai is horrified that Gavilar wants to bring back the gods that their people abandoned long ago. He then gives her a dark yet glowing sphere, which he claims to hold a god, and tells her to give a message to the [[Council of Five]], to remember what they once were and "wake up." Eshonai runs from the room.

Eshonai is at the evening celebration, beating a drum, trying to lose herself in the rhythm. She has told the Five that Gavilar wants to bring back their gods, and that he has the knowledge to do it. [[Klade]] claims to have heard a voice leading him to an [[Szeth|assassin]], and the Five have agreed to have him kill the king. Eshonai weeps as she leaves the celebration.

;Plot Summary
Six days after arriving in [[Urithiru]], [[Dalinar Kholin]] revisits the very first vision he experienced. Having become a [[Knights Radiant|Knight Radiant]] by bonding the [[Stormfather]] himself, he can enter any of the visions at will and has enough control to not need to be tied down. He is on a cliff with the Almighty, viewing the ruins of [[Kholinar]] below. He asks him to transport him down to the rubble. He sees gouges on the stones as if made from claws. He concludes that Kholinar will not fall to the [[Everstorm]], but to something worse that will come after. The Stormfather agrees. Dalinar is frustrated that the monarchs of the world will not unite with him despite the threat. A final wave of destruction closes the vision, and Dalinar insists on staying to watch. He sees a golden light and a dark figure with nine shadows. Stormfather identifies the shadows as the [[Unmade]], the spren of [[Odium]]. He comes out of the vision with [[Navani Kholin]] standing nearby. He knows he must unite the world before their enemy destroys it. Navani pledges to help despite their current situation, which is already desperate. A messenger comes and reports that [[Torol Sadeas]] had been murdered.

;Plot Summary
'''Adolin'''

Adolin supervises the influx of people and supplies into Urithiru. He's glad for the distraction; he finds it hard to believe that he has actually murdered Sadeas. A messenger comes to report that something has been discovered on the third floor. Adolin knows what it is.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar rushes to the scene to prevent a fight between Sadeas's officers and the men of [[Bridge Four]], whom they accuse of murdering their highprince. Dalinar examines the body and notes that the blood is dried, so the murder took place some time ago. The soldiers claim that they have been looking for Sadeas and kept getting lost in the confusing corridors.

Dalinar's sons and some scribes arrive at the scene. His officer corps is severely depleted, so other [[Highprince|highprinces]] are there as well, including [[Turinad Sebarial]] and his mistress, [[Palona]]. She's the first to voice the opinion that Sadeas's death was actually beneficial since he was causing so much trouble. Dalinar leads the group outside and warns them of worse things to come and that they must lead the world against them. His ultimate goal is to unite the entire continent, something never done before. He appoints the highprinces that follow him to various positions in the kingdom. He orders [[Shallan]] and [[Renarin Kholin]] to practice their powers so they can lead the other Knights that will eventually come to them.

;Plot Summary
:''Thirty-four years ago''
Dalinar marches toward the enemy army through a burning field. He emerges from the smoke with his elite guard and ferociously attacks, causing some of the enemy to flee in terror. He drives through the spearmen and laughs as he kills. He feels invigorated but does not yet feel the [[Thrill]], so he seeks out a greater challenge. He sees a brightlord on a horse surrounded by an honor guard and attacks. He makes his way through and orders [[Jenin]] to shoot the horse. As Dalinar engages the crown prince, a strap on his shield breaks. His enemy gains the advantage and is about to finish him off, but the Thrill comes, giving him more strength and dexterity. He stabs his foe in the chest. Nearly dead, the man asks Dalinar why he had come for them. He doesn't know; he just goes where his brother [[Gavilar Kholin]] sends him in order to consolidate his reign. As he orders his men to take hostages in the village, an arrow slams into his shoulder. They see the [[Teleb|assassin]] on a ridge above the town and ride up on horses, capturing him. Dalinar is amazed at his skill and recruits him into his own army by promising not to pillage the town. They ride back to the town, where the local highprince's and his officers' heads are displayed on spears as a result of Sadeas' executions. Sadeas is disappointed that he can't loot the town.

;Plot Summary
The Everstorm returns two days after Sadeas is found dead. Dalinar learns from the Stormfather that this is a new phenomenon. He gazes into the storm and sees a vision of destruction. The Stormfather confirms that the enemy is with the storm and is watching him. Navani is there and touches his face with her bare safehand. They kiss, but Dalinar won't go further -- he insists on some sort of wedding, but none of the ardents will marry them because of the old taboo that they are related. Navani grows concerned that Dalinar thinks she is trying to replace his late wife, and he reveals that he doesn't even remember her because of the [[Old Magic]]. He does remember a feeling of hatred and having the Thrill on the day of her death. Dalinar suggests that the Stormfather marry them.

Dalinar and Navani's family gather on the roof of the tower along with some other officers and brightlords. Navani has managed to find traditional wedding garb. [[Elhokar Kholin]] gives only a cool blessing to the marriage, but does stay to watch. The Stormfather arrives and has them swear an oath of loyalty to each other, after which he abruptly leaves. The attendees, even Elhokar, cheerfully congratulate the newlyweds. They all leave except for Kadash, who is displeased with the wedding and Dalinar's assertion that the Almighty is dead, with only a remnant spren remaining. Dalinar suddenly remembers the day when Kadash joined the ardentia after he was so disgusted at what he saw on the battlefield. Kadash warns that the ardentia is angry with Dalinar's blasphemies. Dalinar insists he is telling the truth, at least as he sees it. Kadash reminds Dalinar that he can make mistakes; after all, he was with him on 'that day'.

[[Kaladin]] walks toward [[Hearthstone]], having run out of [[Stormlight]] three days prior. The Everstorm had arrived there earlier that day. He begins to find debris along the way. [[Syl]] cheerily chats with Kaladin as he gloomily approaches the town, afraid of what he'll find.

The light rain of the [[Weeping]] has resumed. Kaladin waits until nightfall to enter the town. He doesn't see any signs of life. Syl notes the presence of [[gloomspren]], which are uncommon for some unknown reason. He approaches [[Roshone]]'s manor and sees light inside. A guard opens the door and orders him inside.

;Plot Summary
Kaladin enters and recognizes people from the town, but they don't recognize him, probably due to his ragged appearance. He has gone several days without shaving and his worn uniform appears as if it is a size too small. He starts to look for his parents, but the guard tries to order him to see Roshone. Kaladin shoves him away and gives him his best sergeant's glare, then continues his search of the manor. He hears the moans of wounded and follows the sound, hoping that his parents would be attending them. [[Lirin]] is indeed there working on someone, and it takes a moment for him to recognize his son. Lirin calls [[Hesina]] in, but before Kaladin can truly reunite, he confesses that he failed and could not prevent the death of [[Tien]]. His parents tell Kaladin that they were informed that Kaladin was dead too. They have a tearful reunion, his parents with joy, Kaladin for his grief over Tien.

Kaladin sips some soup while Syl stares at Hesina, perplexed about something. The guard insists that Kaladin be taken into custody because he is branded as a deserter, but Lirin threatens to quit as the town's surgeon. Hesina explains to Kaladin that Roshone has softened, presumably from guilt. Syl tells Kaladin that she knew his family, even before she met him, because everyone is connected. She mentions another voice, "Pure, with a song like tapped crystal, distant yet demanding." Roshone appears, older and more feeble, but still with an imperious bearing. After some goading by Roshone, Kaladin punches him in the face, saying "that was for my friend [[Moash]]."

;Plot Summary
Roshone orders the guards to attack Kaladin, but they note his obvious ability and hesitate. Kaladin regrets his juvenile action and apologizes, telling the guards to stand down. He then orders them into the library for a meeting, but Roshone asks why he should take orders from him. Kaladin summons his [[Shardblade]], allowing his eyes to turn blue.

In the library, Kaladin finds out that the Parshmen transformed and then just left town. Kaladin wants to figure out where they went, so he asks for maps and a [[spanreed]] to communicate with Dalinar, giving Roshone several spheres for the "rental" of some horses since he's out of Stormlight. The soldiers go to the lady of the house ([[Laral]]) to ask for the maps. Kaladin warns Syl that he might need her again as a weapon, and she reassures him that it doesn't bother her. All of his weapons were "people" anyway. Kaladin brandishes his sword again for Roshone to emphasize that he's in charge. Despite Roshone's faults, he needs to help the people of [[Hearthstone]]. Roshone just slumps in his chair, but Laral arrives and pledges to lead the people. She looks quite different, more mature and practical. He says he wanted to come back to save her, but she says that she is happy with Roshone and resents Kaladin's judgment of him. She goes to set up the spanreed and wait for a reply, so Kaladin goes back to his parents. He starts helping his father tend the wounded. He is disappointed that Kaladin has become one of "them," a person who tries to solve problems with violence. He does acknowledge that the [[Voidbringers]] must be fought, but he wanted his son to be a surgeon, not a killer. Kaladin goes back to the library and notices that the spanreed is glowing with Stormlight; they collected some during the last unexpected [[highstorm]]. The spanreed starts writing words from Navani, much to the surprise of Laral. Dalinar asks for a status and Kaladin suggests he go looking for the Voidbringers because they just up and left without attacking. Dalinar agrees and tells him to take the spanreed with him to keep him up to date. He closes the conversation and goes to see his mother. She is holding a baby, Kaladin's new brother, [[Oroden]], which means ''child of peace''. Kaladin holds him and cries. Kaladin asks for any infused spheres and trades them two for one. Kaladin tells Lirin that he wants to take his family away to safety, but his father refuses; he is the town surgeon and is needed there. The others in the house overhear the conversation about the [[Desolation]] being here, so Kaladin puts on a display with Stormlight and promises that the [[Knights Radiant]] have returned and will not fail them. He flies off to a nearby town to get more infused spheres.

;Plot Summary
Shallan tries to draw the towers of Urithiru, but is having trouble comprehending the massive city. [[Pattern]] tells her that he understands why she would hate him, but she only hates the sword, which leaves both of them confused. A [[Lyn|scout]] comes and reports that the highprince wants to see her. She marvels at the drawings despite Shallan's frustration with them. As they walk, she notices the notoriety she has as a Radiant. She pretends to be an [[Elsecaller]] to hide her ability creating illusions. The scout asks her about her sword but seems disappointed that Shallan doesn't intend to use it. She arrives at a meeting room with Navani and Dalinar and his sons. Dalinar is struggling with uniting the various rulers of the continent. He asks Shallan for information, but she has little knowledge of the political world. Dalinar fetches a cup of wine and passes by Shallan, and she is drawn by him to the map on the wall. She draws her remaining Stormlight and creates a three-dimensional projection of the continent in the room. Dalinar believes that the Stormfather helped create the vision since he sees everything in the highstorm, meaning that their powers have somehow merged to do something new. The projection helps him decide to focus on securing the [[Oathgate]]s in [[Azir]], [[Jah Keved]], and [[Thaylenah]]. Lyn, the scout who fetched Shallan, knocks on the door and reports that another murder has been discovered.

The murder appears to be an exact copy of how Sadeas was killed, including the location of the wound and the positioning of the body. Adolin appears shocked and distracted. Dalinar assigns him to investigate the murder since so many other officers were killed in all the recent fighting. Adolin is taken aback and appears nervous.

;Plot Summary
'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin approaches a village called [[Hornhollow]] and chats with Syl. She notices that he is rather happy at the moment, having found his mother alive and being buoyed by Stormlight. Syl and Kaladin wonder if she could someday be a mother herself; after all, the Stormfather birthed her. He flies into the center of town and is about to grandly introduce himself, but word has traveled ahead about him, and they offer him infused spheres, hoping for a favorable exchange rate. The townspeople seem eager to see him. The citylord mentions an attack by rogue Parshmen, the first report of an attack so far in Kaladin's reconnaissance trip.

A nervous ardent explains that the Parshmen attacked the grain storage and ran off when an alarm was sounded. Syl tells him that the ardent is infatuated with him, and teases that she must be desperate, considering how disheveled he looks. He dismisses the idea, saying that she would have to marry another ardent. Syl counters that it isn't marriage she wants from him and offers to teach Kaladin about sex. Then she tries to play matchmaker with him and Shallan. He's interested in her but dismisses the idea because she's engaged to Adolin. He then realizes that Syl will be around when he's having sex. The citylord introduces a scout to Kaladin who had followed the Parshmen. They were heading straight for Kholinar. He flies off in pursuit to the cheers of the villagers.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin goes to visit [[Gallant]]. They mourn the death of [[Sureblood]] as Adolin gives him treats. Renarin appears; he has been looking for Adolin. He suggests having Shallan draw Sureblood. He also says that he must give back the Shardblade because it hurts to hold. Renarin reluctantly admits that he has created his own blade now and shows Adolin, who admires it for its beauty. Renarin is not content though; he was starting to fit in with Bridge Four, but now he must pivot to being a Knight Radiant. He's afraid that he will make a mistake trying to use his new power. Adolin clasps his hand to give him confidence, and he feels a wash of Stormlight through his body. He sees a vision of himself, perfected and whole. Renarin is embarrassed and leaves, and Adolin is surprised that his wounded wrist is now healed.

;Plot Summary
''Thirty-three years ago''

Dalinar impatiently awaits for the battle to begin, wearing his new shardplate. Gavilar and Sadeas are with him. Their efforts at quelling the other princedoms have only resulted in most of them uniting against Gavilar's rule. Sadeas discusses a political marriage with Dalinar, but he is not interested. The only woman he loves (Navani) is already married, with a daughter. The fog finally rises from the city, and they discuss the lord of the city, [[Tanalan's father|Tanalan]], who has a Shardblade, but not plate. Gavilar gallops off and Dalinar eagerly follows, determined to win the blade. They are pelted with arrows, rocks and netting, but they quickly reach the fortifications, wreaking havoc on the defending soldiers. When Dalinar jumps back down to destroy the catapults he misjudges his plate's weight and falls down, bending his hammer's handle. He then vows to never make a greenvine mistake like this again. After getting a new hammer from Sadeas he continues his barrage, causing the soldiers to flee. He glories in his power and the Thrill. The catapults neutralized, the army moves through the city gates. Dalinar looks down at the city and feels that something is wrong. Suddenly, the entire precipice collapses and falls into the Rift. Dalinar crashes through many layers of buildings. His Shardplate is damaged, but he survives, unlike the elites that fell with him. Next comes a hail of arrows at him. He runs across a bridge as two soldiers attempt to collapse it, which would send Dalinar another hundred feet down. He is saved by Teleb, who shoots the soldiers. He meets Tanalan, who questions why he should submit to the "king." Dalinar's reasoning is that the strongest military commander should win the throne, and attacks. He manages to get within the reach of his blade and wounds Tanalan. More archers shoot at Dalinar, but he collapses the platform, mortally wounding the brightlord. When the guards carry him away, Dalinar finds he has more wounds from his duel with Tanalan, but the Thrill pushes him along, driving away pain. He sees Tanalan taken through a secret door in the rock and follows. He finds him lying in his blood, a beautiful woman at his side, crying. Their son, only a small boy, challenges Dalinar with his father's Shardblade.

Hours later, Dalinar rests with his new Shardblade, [[Oathbringer (Shardblade)|Oathbringer]], sipping wine to help with the pain and shame he feels. Gavilar sits down beside him and wonders what the consequences of the day will be. The remaining people will rebel because Dalinar had killed their highlord and heir. Dalinar suggests he makes soldiers out of them. Gavilar knows they need to act differently, to have an actual functioning government rather than destroying and pillaging for control. Dalinar leans back to rest and remembers the sound of a brave boy crying.

;Plot Summary
Dalinar ponders the ancient Knights Radiant and asks the Stormfather what caused their betrayal. He refuses to answer, as some things are better left forgotten. The emperor of Azir has contacted him by spanreed, and Dalinar invites him to visit Urithiru via the Oathgate. They answer vaguely, so Navani suggests an offer of aid to get them to come. They again demur, slightly changing the subject to talk about the new enemy. The Voidbringers did not attack them either, and they are in negotiations with them, ostensibly in order to stall so they can build up their fortifications. Dalinar urges that they allow him to come there through the portal, but they report that it no longer works. Navani and [[Teshav]] believe they are lying. Next, the [[Fen Rnamdi|queen]] of [[Thaylenah]] makes contact. Dalinar uses formal language, but she is more blunt and sarcastic. There, the Voidbringers stole most of their ships, and the city itself is in shambles from the Everstorm. Dalinar informs her that he intends to convene a council of monarchs around the world, but she is skeptical of his intentions and is not interested in attending. Dalinar feels like her responses are a bit out of character, as Thaylens seek political opportunities. He offers troops to help with rebuilding the city, but she is reluctant. He then tells her how to find Radiants among her own people and offers to help train them. She replies that she will consider his offer and signs off. He talks to other lesser monarchs but doesn't make much headway; he needs the endorsement of Azir for other surrounding kingdoms to follow along. Dalinar begins to leave the room and finds Elhokar standing without at the doorway. He suggests that maybe the others won't cooperate because they are afraid he'll usurp their thrones. Then he admits that he isn't doing well as king and begins to abdicate the throne to Dalinar. Instead, they agree to let Dalinar be the king of Urithiru and the Shattered Plains, forfeiting his Alethkar lands to his heir. Elhokar wants to restore [[Kholinar]], which is rioting, and Dalinar agrees to send him in with the Windrunner, Kaladin, so they can activate the Oathgate and let in troops from Urithiru. A new message comes in from [[Taravangian]], king of [[Jah Keved]] and [[Kharbranth]]. He fully agrees with Dalinar's plan and has a Radiant at hand to try their Oathgate.

;Plot Summary
Shallan transforms herself into Veil. She practices walking with a more confident gait and talking with a deeper, rougher voice. She looks over her sketches of Veil to try to refine the look. She wants to be able to transform quickly, without needing to review them. Someone knocks at her doorway, so she invites them in, assuming it's [[Palona]]. It turns out to be Adolin, who sees her in only her nightgown, safehand exposed! She hurriedly dresses while they flirt through the doorway as he waits outside with food and books. She admits him and begins eating. Adolin realizes that this is her bedroom and wonders if it's proper for them to be alone, so Shallan enlists Pattern as a chaperone to prevent them from doing anything "inappropriate" (which he later realizes is "mating"). Adolin convinces Shallan to try some men's food, and it burns her mouth. He has brought several books to help her with her political knowledge since she was lacking in their last meeting with Dalinar. Adolin expresses his concern with the betrothal: he doesn't want to mess this one up like all his other numerous courtships. Shallan reassures him, and they start to kiss until Pattern starts yelling at them to stop.

Kaladin has found some Parshmen and creeps up to the camp, past a single guard, expecting monstrous Voidbringers. Instead, he finds them trying to play [[Rosharan card game|cards]]. Their eyes are not red and they have only limited carapace armor. Some are attempting to light a fire under a tarp. Some eat soggy, raw grain from the stolen sacks. Kaladin realizes that their pathetic state is the humans' fault. Suddenly, one calls the alarm as a yellow ribbon of light streaks by. They grab various primitive weapons but are obviously not trained to use them. Kaladin decides to simply surrender.

;Plot Summary
Shallan discusses the murder investigation with Adolin. Adolin says that he thinks there are two culprits since the two victims are totally disconnected. Shallan thinks that he is being foolish and shouldn't focus on one theory too much. They decide that there isn't anything more to get from the reports, so Adolin changes the subject to her Shardblade. He convinces her that even though she's a woman, she needs to learn how to use it, and he can train her. She agrees, and he goes to fetch the Blade guards. Shallan freaks out, as she is still not over the fact that she killed her mother with her Blade. Pattern believes that she hates him and offers to die so another spren can take his place. She creates an alternate identity -- someone confident and poised, like [[Jasnah]]. She names her Brightness Radiant. With that persona she is able to overcome the history of the blade. Adolin returns and teaches her the importance of a proper stance and breathing. Shallan dismisses her Blade and sketches the proper stance to help her get it right. They practice some simple strikes together. Shallan sees the passion that Adolin has for swordsmanship and realizes that it parallels her passion for art, feeling a bond with him, even allowing herself to become Shallan occasionally. They practice long into the evening.

;Plot Summary
Dalinar examines the Honorblade that Kaladin obtained from Szeth. He tentatively touches the blade, which feels warm to the touch but doesn't scream. Dalinar probes the Stormfather for information about Honor and Odium and learns that Odium must follow certain rules since he's basically a force of nature. Dalinar asks if Honor's suggestion of asking Odium to provide a champion will work. The Stormfather says that it might work, and if man wins, it will buy them precious time. Dalinar reinserts the blade into the sewer and returns to his rooms, where Bridge Thirteen, his guard for the day, awaits. One member, [[Rial]], strikes up a conversation with Dalinar, hinting that he shouldn't have wandered off alone. He goes down to a level where his soldiers are training and offers to spar with [[Kelerand]], one of the ardent swordmasters. He stiffly refuses (due to Dalinar's heresy), and all the ardents but one leave. While Dalinar waits for a sparring partner, he converses with [[Zahel]], the only ardent to remain. He explains that they are torn between loyalty to their highprince and to God. Dalinar seeks out an opponent himself, too impatient to wait for Kelerand to return, and finds [[Aratin]]. They begin to wrestle, and the younger man easily gains the upper hand. Dalinar considers accessing the [[Thrill]] and even Stormlight, but eventually gives up when Navani shows up. He drinks some water and chastises himself for pushing the match too far, trying to come to grips with his age. Navani informs him that the Iriali queen is ready to talk now, and he insists on conversing with her there while he spars with the sword. He tosses a sword to [[Kadash]] and they spar while he dictates to Navani. They argue about religion. The queen says they are considering making a treaty with the Voidbringers. She also holds a grudge for Dalinar's stolen Shardplate. Kadash urges Dalinar to recant his claim that the Almighty is dead, appealing to tradition. Dalinar counters that just because something is tradition doesn't make it right. Dalinar ends the duel and Navani reports that the queen demands the Shardplate, even though her claim is tenuous because she isn't related to [[Evi]]. Dalinar realizes that he can now hear his former wife's name. More memories flood his mind, causing him to collapse.

The Parshman playing cards unties him from the tree, and they start out. Kaladin converses with his captor, who has been joined by his young daughter. He realizes that they are essentially runaway slaves, and points out that he was a slave once too. The Parshman does not identify with him, however, because their minds were taken from them, not just their freedom. They march on, and Kaladin tries to talk to Syl, who is flitting around like a windspren. He thinks that there is trouble with the bond again, but she tells him that she's just pretending because the voidspren might be able to see her. She explains to him that the Parshmen have had their Identity restored by the [[Everstorm]]. Kaladin wants to help them, so he starts giving them advice. He cuts his bands with Syl and starts to teach them how to obtain and preserve food. They decide to return his possessions, and he builds a fire for them.

;Plot Summary
Shallan becomes Veil. She sneaks out of her room and heads toward the market. On the way, Pattern tells Shallan that he likes Adolin. He doesn't mind that he wields a corpse because that's just how things work in the [[Physical Realm]]; you must destroy to survive. She arrives at the market in the [[Breakaway]] and just sits around for a while, listening to conversation. She then finds a low-end tavern in which to practice. She ignorantly orders some very strong "wine" and almost throws up. She continues to drink the stuff, and a [[Jor|bouncer]] nearby starts flirting with her. She becomes intoxicated but manages to ask him where any stabbings have taken place. She tries to leave but collapses on the floor. She uses some Stormlight to ease the pain, and she's suddenly not drunk. She heads out to [[All's Alley]], site of a recent stabbing. She asks for the strongest stuff they have and ends up with some [[Horneater white]]. She downs a few drinks, healing herself as she goes. She probes the barkeep about any recent murders, and he directs her to a group of thugs in the corner. She sits down in the seat of a [[Ur|Horneater]] and starts asking a woman named Betha about the murderer. Ur comes back from the restroom and throws her out of the seat. She comes back and places her safehand on his hand and stabs them both with a knife, getting the seat back from him. Veil threatens to do worse unless she starts getting answers, and idly scrapes the symbol of the Ghostbloods on the table. Intimidated, Betha reveals that a man named Ned had strangled his wife, and then the next night he had come back and killed a barmaid the same exact way, although he vehemently denied the second murder.

Dalinar sits at a feast while [[Toh]] talks with Gavilar. He's bored by politics and wishes that instead he could go and eat with his men. Dalinar starts to eat and realizes that he doesn't have his knife with him. He wants to just dig in with his hands, but everyone is using utensils, so he leaves the dining hall in the middle of the highstorm to go find his knife. He finds the bunker where Teleb is and pounds on the door. When no one answers, he summons his Shardblade and cuts his way in. Teleb tells him that he returned his knife, so Dalinar heads back. He dodges a boulder on the way and sees some sort of monster on glowing legs. He forces his way back into the feast hall, and everyone stares at him incredulously. Toh is disturbed and excuses himself. Gavilar is actually glad because Dalinar just demonstrated that he could protect them. Navani walks in, so Dalinar orders more strong wine. She and Ialai join the king, and they discuss Toh and his wife, who is deemed to be dense, but honest. Toh is bargaining with Shardplate that he has stolen from his native land, [[Rira (country)|Rira]]. They discuss the possibility of Dalinar marrying Evi and gaining the Shardplate. A servant brings Dalinar a knife, but it's too small; Dalinar bends it cutting his steak. He spots Evi across the room and admires her blonde hair. Then he finally spots a good knife: in the hands of an assassin taking Gavilar's plates. Dalinar knocks the man down to the floor and stabs him repeatedly, killing him. Then he washes the blood off the knife with his wine and starts eating with it. He agrees to marry Evi to help forge an alliance. Gavilar is sure they'll accept after seeing Dalinar in action.

Kaladin tells him that he doesn't have to fight the humans, but Sah believes that they will try to enslave him again. Syl informs Kaladin that a highstorm is coming soon.

Adolin offers an infused ruby mark, and she's able to completely heal, headache and all. He asks for her to visit Ialai with him.

Shallan goes to Sebarial's sitting room to meet Adolin after getting ready. Sebarial lives in luxury, with cots and a masseuse. He is already formulating a plan to tax the passage through the Oathgates, as that will be a vital source of income to maintain Urithiru. Adolin insists on bringing two of her guards along, not so much for protection, but for prestige. [[Vathah]] leads them while [[Gaz]] guards their back. Adolin coaches Shallan on keeping her soldiers busy so they will feel needed and important. Shallan compliments him on being like his father, but he seems to resist the praise, hiding something. They arrive at Sadeas's area and are escorted in to see Ialai. Mraize is there, standing beside her.

She also dismisses Shallan to go fetch tea. Shallan reluctantly obeys only so she can talk to Mraize. He calls her out for using the Ghostblood symbol the night before, but says that is allowed since she is a member. She demands to know about her brothers, and he assures her that they are safe. However, she does have a debt to him for the broken soulcaster, so he gives her a task: secure Urithiru by getting rid of the "darkness" that is there. In exchange, he hints that he will tell her what happened to [[Helaran]]. She brings back some tea for her and Adolin only and goes back to the main room. Ialai suggests to Adolin that he search among his own people for the assassin, since someone might have acted on Dalinar's behalf without a direct order. She then shocks them both by telling them to report their findings to [[Meridas Amaram]]. The meeting ends and they leave, wondering why Ialai is trusting Amaram since he's been discredited.

The parshmen file into the bunker, their numbers enhanced by others who have joined them, led by other Voidspren. Khen promises to speak for Kaladin at the gathering for his assistance. Kaladin sits down and wonders how long he can delay going back to Urithiru; he feels out of touch with events. Suddenly, the Voidspren, appearing as a woman, glowing yellow, flies up to him.

Dalinar waits at an Oathgate, thinking about his wife. He can only remember what she looks like and how they came to be betrothed. He remembers that her death led him to excessive drinking and visiting the [[Nightwatcher]], but he doesn't remember what he asked for. The Oathgate opens, and Taravangian arrives with his head scribe, [[Adrotagia]]. He acts rather dense and needs prompting from her. He introduces [[Malata]], a [[Dustbringer]].

Taravangian rides up the elevator and continues to act almost childlike. Adrotagia has to answer for him when Dalinar asks about [[Kharbranth]]. They arrive at the top level where Navani meets them. While the newcomers are given a brief tour, Dalinar and Navani wonder if Taravangian will be of any use in his condition. More memories return to Dalinar, and Navani is puzzled because, having done some research, she's never known of a case in which the curse goes away. Taravangian asks about the other monarchs and is informed that he is the only one who has come so far. He suggests attacking, to the dismay of Dalinar. That is just the suspicion that he wished the monarchs didn't have, but it was to be expected, given his history. He says he will not attack, but it's obvious that Adrotagia doesn't believe him.

;Plot Summary
Shallan is exploring Urithiru. She finds a theater and uses her lightweaving to show Pattern a play. The play is of a girl who lives in a village surrounded by a wall. The girl curiously asks the townsfolk why the wall is there. She doesn't receive a satisfying answer, so she decides to climb the wall. Spikes and statues make the climbing easy, even so the climbing takes days. On the other side of the wall she sees stairs and walks down to another village that has Stormlight. She takes the Stormlight and brings it to her village. Pattern is very interested in the play but Shallan runs out of Stormlight before she finishes. She realizes that she created an audience, though the figures are vague. She pulls back in the Stormlight, telling Pattern the rest of the story before she notices that one of the audience wasn't her creation. She chases after it. After entering a room she sees various figures of herself as a child, Veil, etc. The figures fade away, leaving her alone, her quarry lost. She notes several shafts that lead to the market, and sees the black figure, whom she thinks is a spren, climbing through one of them. She runs to the market but doesn't get there in time. Rock is stabbed in the hand by the black figure that she thinks impersonated Veil. She realizes that Rock is similar to the Horneater she stabbed earlier. She turns to leave, and [[Ishnah]], who witnessed her using the Ghostblood's symbol the night before, asks to join her. Shallan rebuffs her.

;Plot Summary
:''Twenty-nine years ago''
Dalinar prepares for battle, in prayer with his betrothed, Evi. She encourages him to not kill in anger, to "be a man and not a beast." He leaves to fight in what should be a decisive battle for the kingdom. Gavilar notes that Sebarial hasn't shown up, ostensibly due to supply line problems, but Dalinar believes he's just waiting to join the winning side. A small number of Ryshadium gallop by, musicspren trailing behind. Gavilar tells Dalinar to kill [[Kalanor]], the Shardbearer highprince, to finally quell all resistance to the kingdom. The battle begins, and Dalinar seeks out a section of Kholin troops doing poorly, then attacks. He gets so enthralled he doesn't realize how many he is killing. Kadash finally snaps him out of it, and Dalinar has realized that he's killed some of his own troops. His slaughter has drawn out Kalanor. Dalinar seeks him out, regretting that he can only kill one man instead of hundreds. He finds Kalanor on a Ryshadium. Dalinar fights him and the two end up on a high ledge. After trading blows, Kalanor stumbles back, losing his blade, holding on for dear life, begging mercy from Dalinar. He runs him through the face with his Shardblade, but feels oddly dissatisfied. The Thrill fills him with strength and arrogance -- all others are weak, and he deserves to rule. He dashes to Gavilar, intending to kill him, but realizes that he is about to murder his brother and stops. He gives up his newly acquired Shardplate and blade to Gavilar for his heir. Dalinar vows to never be king.

;Plot Summary
Shallan is in a meeting with Dalinar and the highprinces, not really paying attention. She should act as Radiant would, but she draws instead. She shows a picture of the creature she chased to Pattern, and he doesn't know what it is exactly, only that it is of Odium. Next she turns to her sketches of the victims. She realizes that each of the second victims looks like the first ones. Malata wanders over to talk with Shallan. She says she doesn't belong to Taravangian, that [[Spark]] suggested they check out Urithiru. Shallan does not see her spren. Malata suggests that the Radiants need not gather, that the Desolation claimed by the Alethi may be made up. She leaves, then Ialai enters, announcing that Amaram is the highprince of the Sadeas princedom. Dalinar accepts him, but Adolin insults him and is dismissed by his father. Shallan follows and tells Adolin that she thinks that Amaram killed her brother. She's shocked when Adolin reveals that Kaladin was the one who killed the Shardbearer on the battlefield that day, saving Amaram. Adolin goes off to tend his horses, but Shallan stays behind and looks through her sketchbook again. She finds strange, violent pictures that she doesn't remember drawing. Unnerved, she goes to find her soldiers to give them something dangerous to do.

;Plot Summary
Dalinar is frustrated that Azir has refused to open the Oathgate. Azir is planning to destroy their Oathgate. He asks Teshav to contact Queen Fen again. While the spanreed writes back, Dalinar experiments with Adhesion, climbing up to an apparent ventilation shaft on the wall near the ceiling. Queen Fen replies and refuses to enter into a treaty because she thinks that Dalinar, the Blackthorn, is not sincere. Dalinar wanders the halls. After an hour, Lyn finds him and tells him that Bridge Four wants him. They show him Oathbringer. Dalinar picks it up, hearing the scream of the dead spren. He asks the Stormfather if it can be healed, but he knows of no way to do it. He takes it to Ialai and puts it reverently on the floor. He sees Amaram there and reminds him that he will face judgment for killing defenseless men. Amaram calls him a hypocrite, as he has slaughtered thousands with his Shardblade. Dalinar has no response, and seeks solitude in his rooms. Taravangian is there, and they discuss the conundrum of sometimes having to punish the innocent in order to protect society at large. The Stormfather tells Dalinar that he is not a hypocrite, but Dalinar disagrees. He wants to know more about Nohadon, so he asks to see that vision again. The Stormfather offers to show Navani directly, and that gives Dalinar an idea: put Queen Fen into the vision with him.

;Plot Summary
Shallan has ordered her guards to look for violence that has been repeated. She goes to a tavern as Veil to meet with them. They report that nothing has happened since a man was hanged a couple of days ago for killing someone in a bar fight. She leaves the bar and waits, watching the people in the market. She hears screams and rushes to the scene. Someone has been hanged. Vathah reports that Glurv is trailing the killer. She dashes after, using Stormlight-enhanced speed. With Pattern's help, she trails her target to a hidden room with a pit. She sends Pattern to retrieve Adolin for additional protection. While she waits, she turns back into Shallan. Adolin arrives in his Shardplate and the entirety of Bridge Four. They descend into the pit. They find a room covered in murals. The ceiling is a depiction of the ten heralds, and the walls have three figures on them, one of them depicting the Almighty. Adolin opens two locked doors with his Shardblade. Inside they find an old decaying library. Down a third tunnel Renarin sees a large black mass, like glistening tar. He identifies her as [[Re-Shephir]], the Midnight Mother. The Unmade attacks by creating vaguely human figures out of black goo. Adolin and everyone else are forced to retreat. Shallan creates several figures with Lightweaving, and the Unmade shrinks back. Adolin and Bridge Four attack again, Shallan using copies of them to help, but they are again overwhelmed. Shallan touches the mass with her bare safehand.

She wavers because she knows the creature will find out her secrets, so she pretends to be committed. Re-Shephir flees, even more terrified. Shallan decides not to chase it, but orders guards to be posted just in case. Teft notes that that's a good idea since the pillar that Re-Shephir was surrounding is covered with thousands of huge cut gems.

Kaladin sees signs of fighting and wonders where the humans are. Syl reports that they are in the parshmen quarters and open pens and warns that another highstorm is coming. A parshmen scribe orders them to send Kaladin to the pens, but Khen reluctantly recommends that he be allowed to fight with them. The scribe refers them to a [[Fused]], a Parshendi-like creature with lots of carapace and red eyes. It heads over and Kaladin decides it's time to go. He grabs a bag of spheres from Khen and flies off, the highstorm rumbling in the distance. He asks Syl for directions to Urithiru, but she doesn't know the way. He heads east and spies the humans in open pens below. He drops down and tells them to take shelter. Two flying Fused suddenly attack. They have similar powers to him, but aren't as experienced and can't fly through a highstorm as well as Kaladin. He pleads with the Stormfather to divert the storm, but he won't stop. He goes back down and desperately tries to save as many people as possible, but it's not enough. He lashes out with Stormlight and creates a barrier made of windspren, diverting the storm. More people make it inside. One of the Fused is back, but Kaladin lets the storm carry him away as he Lashes himself upward. The Fused give chase but cannot keep up. Syl directs him to Urithiru.

Shallan is still resting from her encounter with Re-Shephir. Her drawing has a more scholarly focus now that Jasnah is back. She's impatient to know how she survived, so she leaves her rooms to find her. She finds out that she's down by the jewel-encrusted pillar, so Shallan descends into the pit, the feeling of wrongness gone. Jasnah speculates that it's an intricate fabrial, and explains to Shallan how they work, trapping a spren and stimulating it to make it work. She tells her to sketch the jewels, and Shallan has a hard time taking orders now, but complies. Jasnah compliments her on her accomplishments while she was away and wants to be filled in about the discovery of Urithiru. When Shallan asks how she survived, she simply answers that she is an Elsecaller. That doesn't mean anything to Shallan, so she explains that she has the ability to go to Shadesmar. Getting back is more difficult, which is why it took so long for her to return. She asks for more sketches of what has happened in her absence and admits that she was wrong about the usefulness of Shallan's drawing skill. Jasnah is frustrated at being so behind current events.

They arrive at the town, and Dalinar is ordered to help the villagers while the Windrunners engage the creatures. He sneaks to the house and finds [[Taffa]]'s body. He makes his way back to the town and finds that Queen Fen has organized the townspeople to fight. She is incredulous that a tyrant such as Dalinar has been chosen to lead the Knights Radiant, if their return is even true. Dalinar argues that she has little option but to let him go to Thaylen City; she is more convinced by his passionate plea than his "diplomatic" language over spanreed. Indeed, she didn't even trust it was him. Now that she has talked to him in person, Dalinar believes she will reconsider.

The battalion lacks officers and scribes and their finances are in shambles. Multiple religions are practiced. Sigzil's Azish training makes him want to bring order to it all. He also suggests recruiting since their numbers are down and members of Bridge Four might go off on their own as Radiants. As they walk down the hall, they see Lyn, and Kaladin asks if she wants to join. At first she is elated -- until he assigns her as a scribe. She declines, but does accept the offer of a formal tryout that Kaladin is setting up. Sigzil brings up many other problems like chain of command and wages, and Kaladin tells him he should have been a scholar. Sigzil admits that he tried but failed the exam; Kaladin tells him it was a stupid exam because they missed out on having him.

;Plot Summary
Rock is cooking stew and surprised at how he finds the barren Shattered Plains beautiful. Kaladin is training crews on how to use Stormlight. He first has them swear the first oath, and Lunamor quietly recites it to himself as he cooks. He instructs Lopen, Sigzil, and Peet to start teaching. Dabbid takes over stirring. Lunamor goes to find Hobber and finds Kaladin kneeling beside him. He tenderly encourages Hobber to try breathing in Stormlight. Rock is skeptical he can do it, but Kaladin insists all of Bridge Four will, and maybe others. He cautions Kaladin that they are going to war and some may die. Several of the bridgemen are glowing; Lopen has stuck his face to the ground. Elhokar appears and asks Kaladin to come with him to Kholinar and reclaim their home. Kaladin agrees and is given twenty days to prepare the rest of the men. Renarin meanwhile comes straight from his daily duty at the Oathgate to be with Bridge Four. Rock invites him over to help cook and notes he can see all spren, but never Renarin's. Renarin wonders if he belongs to Bridge Four since he is not a Windrunner, but Rock insists that he does. He is conflicted over what is expected of him -- to be a warrior, or what he is good at, scholarly work. He feels the odd one out, but Rock points out [[Rlain]]; Renarin goes to sit by him. The men come over for a drink break. Skar is struggling at drawing in Stormlight, but he manages to teach Lunamor how to draw some in. Skar, instead of being jealous, is pleased, being a teacher at heart. Rock suddenly notices a large group of spren gathered to watch Bridge Four practicing. Sylphrena says they wouldn't talk to her because she sought out Kaladin and they hate to admit they were wrong. Rock makes an offering of Stormlight-infused spheres. The human-sized spren draws it in before flying away. Hobber breathes in a bit of Stormlight and calls the bridgemen over. Kaladin tells them to give him all their spheres so his legs can heal. He tentatively stands up, and Lopen gives him the ''two''-armed Bridge Four salute, which Hobber proudly returns. Rock looks to the west and sees a plume of smoke.

Kaladin flies off to investigate. Rock and Bridge Four grab their bridge and start marching. With Stormlight, the task is quite easy. They reach the caravan and see a dead Voidbringer, brought down by an Unkalaki arrow. A makeshift fortification of piled up furniture is nearby. A woman peeks out and Rock realizes it's his family.

Rock introduces his family to his fellow bridgemen. He updates his wife on what happened in his disastrous bid to win Shards from Sadeas. She tells him that something is terribly wrong back at their home. Kaladin promises accommodations for his family. The men of Bridge Four solemnly carry the bridge for the last time. No longer slaves, they will now fly with Stormlight.

;Plot Summary
Dalinar enters the vision fighting with a spear among poorly equipped men. He charges forward toward a company of savage men, but his untrained allies fail to support him; his arm is cut off. Dalinar merely wraps it and continues fighting, thinking that it's "cheating" to heal with Stormlight. A Voidbringer joins the enemy. A Radiant (Stoneward) appears and creates handholds down the cliff so they can escape. The Stormfather says that though Dalinar shares one of the two Surges of the Stonewards, it is not the one that he sees. Dalinar realizes that humans were fighting with the Voidbringers. 

The Stormfather then brings in Jasnah and Navani into the vision at Dalinar's request. They see a Radiant using a device to stimulate Regrowth and Navani rushes off to watch. Jasnah marvels that the civilization is more primitive than that of a previous vision. She worries about how Dalinar will react to being accused as a heretic. She tells him not to let others define who he is. 

They decide to split up and see as much of the vision as possible. Navani returns, dictating her observations to Teshav who is in the same room outside the vision. She hasn't figured out how the healing fabrial works. They run up a hill to see thousands of bodies and other terrible signs of the Desolation. Dalinar is startled to find that the boulder at the top of the hill was actually a slain creature made of stone. They continue on past the corpses to a place with nine Honorblades rammed into stone. They recognize the one that killed Gavilar, the Honorblade that Szeth carried. 

The Stormfather explains that the Voidbringers were given power by Odium, and when they were killed, they were simply reborn into the bodies of parshmen. Humans could never defeat them if they kept reincarnating, so Honor created the Oathpact with five men and five women. After each Desolation they would return to Damnation to hold back the spirits of the dead until a Herald, under torture, broke their oath. The Desolations came more often because it would take a shorter time for one to break. In this "last" Desolation, when nine of them survived, they hoped that the only Herald to never break, Talenelat, would be enough. 4500 years later, another desolation starts.

Dalinar realizes that the "madman" from Kholinar is really Talenelat, though the blade he had when he arrived at the Shattered Plains was not his Honorblade. He asks the Stormfather if the breaking of the Oathpact caused the Recreance, but he refuses to reveal that deeper secret, assuming that it would cause Dalinar to break his oath as well.

Kaladin and Jasnah swap insults regarding their opposing views on how to deal with the ordinary parshmen; Kaladin seeks to spare the innocent while Jasnah sees them as surplus vessels for the immortal Fused to inhabit. Dalinar agrees to attempt negotiations, much to Jasnah's chagrin. Jasnah shocks them all when she suggests they concentrate on finding the Heralds and killing them in order to reseal the Fused. Since spanreeds have become unreliable, Jasnah convinces Kaladin to at least use his windrunners to monitor the movement of Voidbringer troops. 

Jasnah glances at Shallan's notes and notices a sketch of Kaladin, so she calls for a short break. She confronts Shallan's passive-aggressive rebelliousness (and reminding her she is betrothed to her cousin) and Shallan asserts that her wardship is complete. Jasnah offers Shallan high compliments and respect for what she has accomplished on her own, but states that she will remain her ward until she demonstrates minimum requirements for a scholar. Pattern indicates to Shallan that the room they are in has memories, prompting Shallan to tell Jasnah that there may be something in Shadesmar. Jasnah reviews Shallan's notes and commands her to write them out in long hand before submitting them to her brother and mother. She goes back to her room so she can change to Veil and notices a letter pinned to her coat.

;Plot Summary
Shallan reads the letter. It tells of two groups "which presaged the return of the Voidbringers." The [[Sons of Honor]], led by Gavilar and Amaram, worked to bring about the Desolations in order to draw out the [[Herald]]s and restore power to the Vorin church. The [[Skybreaker]]s, an order of Radiants whose members had not broken their oaths, led by Nale, hunted down and killed anyone who had, or were about to form a bond to spren, because Nale thought that that would ''prevent'' the Voidbringers from coming back. Helaran was recruited by Nale, but was not accepted fully, so he may have taken it upon himself to kill Amaram to prove his worth. Or perhaps there was a potential Radiant in his army; if that was the case, it was not Kaladin, or he would have been killed while a slave. The letter abruptly ends. Shallan destroys the letter and goes out as Veil.

Veil enters the common room and finds Shallan's soldiers playing a game. She complains about Shallan a bit, then joins the game, betting some spheres. She wins, astounding the others with her skill. They ask Veil if Shallan will give them something else to do and advise her to tell Shallan that they aren't good men. Veil recognizes a laundry girl and grabs her: it's Ishnah. She claims to have been a spy for another Brightlady, so she has useful skills. Veil tells her she can prove herself if she trains her men well. Otherwise, she has to leave her alone. Ishnah agrees.

Teft wakes up in an alleyway after a night of indulging in [[firemoss]]. He stumbles to a well for water and contemplates suicide. He sees the reflection of a spren in the water and angrily tells it to find someone who cares. He wanders away from the well and realizes it's morning. He can't bring himself to return to the barracks. The spren appears again, but he just turns aside into the firemoss den from the night before, indulging in three more bowls. He no longer uses for euphoria -- just to be able to function. He wakes up with his head on the table in a puddle of drool. Kaladin and Rock have found him. Kaladin asks him where his coat is, and Teft admits that he has sold it.

They carry him back to the barracks and give him some stew. He apologizes and promises to let them help him. He knows he won't have any moss for a few days and is ashamed that that is his most pressing concern.

Dalinar is in the vision of the Aharietiam with Yanagawn. He has assigned the young emperor as a common soldier, but Dalinar makes sure he doesn't die in the battle. The Radiant arrives and the battle is drawn away from them. Yanagawn walks away from Dalinar and starts chatting with some of the wounded soldiers. Jezerezeh'Elin himself is there, proclaiming the final victory over the Voidbringers. Dalinar approaches Yanagawn and identifies himself, saying that he brought him into the vision, but Yanagawn is skeptical. Dalinar shows him the terrible battlefield and tries to convince him to join Alethkar so they can fight the Voidbringers together. The last time an Alethi united with Azir, the Sunmaker led a reign of terror with arbitrary purges. Dalinar insists that he is different because he is old enough to have seen the consequences of war. Suddenly Lift shows up, and Gawx joyously greets her. She tells him not to trust the Blackthorn, and they vanish. The Stormfather is upset that the Nightwatcher has somehow given her the power to leave the vision.

His regret and shame lead to thoughts of suicide. The camp is suddenly attacked by four Fused, and they quickly kill his companions. Moash manages to avoid the initial attack and squares off with a Fused that moves like a Windrunner. He dismisses his Shardblade and instead fights using his training from Kaladin. He manages to kill one, later revealed to be Leshwi, and faces off with the other three. They are so impressed with him that they give him the chance to join them and live.

;Plot Summary
Veil sits in a tavern with Gaz, Vathah, and Red while Ishnah trains them. She has them close their eyes and describe the people in the tavern. Veil is able to do much better than the men, although she does miss one nondescript woman in a corner who appears to be an informant. Ishnah coaches them in ways to observe and remember things. Vathah is learning the best of the three, seeming to enjoy this duty much more than other assignments. Veil realizes that she is late for a meeting and bolts, telling the others to keep practicing.

Shallan arrives late at the meeting of the scribes. She feels anxious about being around such learned people, and briefly contemplates producing another persona to deal with it, but she dismisses the idea. Shallan ''should'' be the scholar. Navani calls the meeting to order. Renarin timidly joins the meeting. They start to discuss the fabrials of the tower, and he makes an insightful comment. Janala mocks him for his apparent knowledge in the feminine arts, and Shallan calls her out, insulting her in turn. Jasnah calls for a break and scolds Shallan for her outburst and expresses regret at taking on a ward. Shallan slinks off to the side. Renarin thanks her for defending his honor. He believes that the entire city is somehow an entire fabrial. He tells her that she can stand up to Jasnah more, or better yet, just not be around her. That gives her the idea to take off with Kaladin in the mission to Kholinar. The meeting starts up again, and Dalinar comes in to observe. Shallan realizes that he's done that to support his son being there.

They ask for "volunteers" for various jobs, but the human slaves don't eat if they don't work. Moash sees some caravaneers -- his old profession -- and asks for [[Guff]]. He finds him and asks for work. Guff realizes that Moash was trained as a soldier, so he brings him to [[Paladar]], regent of Highprince [[Vamah]]. He asks Moash if anyone is coming to save him, and Moash is stunned that the same hierarchy exists even though they are all slaves. He just stands there, unable to answer, and Paladar orders Guff beaten for bringing him. Moash goes to volunteer for hard labor.

Skar races up a ramp in Urithiru in full pack and equipment as part of Sigzil's tests of their abilities. Skar is slow because he still can't draw in Stormlight. They are all waiting for Kaladin to transport them to the Shattered Plains. Teft brings him some food and tries to encourage him. Skar aches to fight with the spear but knows he'll have to cook with Rock if he can't learn to Surgebind. Kaladin finally arrives; he has brought with him more recruits. He activates the Oathgate and they arrive in [[Narak]]. Waiting there is [[Ristina]], a scribe, who reports that some merchants were annoyed at the delay. Kaladin snaps back that the Knights Radiant are not doormen. They pass some soldiers practicing with bridges and Skar thinks of how his unhealed slave brand further separates him from the others. They arrive at the original Bridge Four, now held permanently in place. Kaladin worries that none of the recruits have been drawing in Stormlight, so he's broadened his recruiting to increase the chances. Kaladin sends off the squires to practice flying. The recruits he works out in formations on Teft's suggestion. Skar is about to practice again with a gemstone but sees Lyn off by herself, obviously frustrated, and decides to go commiserate. He tells her of the first time he noticed Kaladin using Stormlight, using the Surge of [[Gravitation]] to divert arrows away from him. He didn't even know what he was doing, so maybe they were just trying too hard. Lyn desperately wants to fly with the Windrunners, but Skar tells her that that isn't enough. She has to want to protect, like Kaladin. She is finally successful in drawing in Stormlight. Skar is wistful but eventually becomes excited for Lyn's success. He tells Rock that he just might join the support team since he won't be able to fly, but Rock points out that he is glowing.

He reports that Odium stirs and wants to destroy all mankind and spren like him. Jasnah's thoughts turn to a childhood illness with hints of a betrayal. She asks Ivory what he thinks of Shallan, and his opinion is that she is unstable -- even more so than most humans -- and that Cryptics are trouble.

Moash pulls at a cart with steel skids instead of wheels. It's easy compared to bridge duty. Hundreds of humans around him also pull wagons or sledges. It's obvious to Moash that they are marching to invade Kholinar. He starts to feel as though the humans didn't deserve to govern anyway. He admires the efficiency and fairness of the Parshendi army -- with one exception: a group of parshman slaves. They are whipped and treated poorly, set apart from all the other sledges.

During a quick water break, Moash asks his overseer why that group of parshmen are treated so badly. She responds that they had harbored a "false god" (a Knight Radiant) and brought it among them. They continue on after the break, and after some time one of the exhausted parshmen slips and falls, causing their sledge to stop. Moash sees the whipping start again and gets fed up. He attacks the two overseers and takes the injured man's place. The overseers let it go, even after conferring with the Fused. No one whips the parshmen for the rest of the march.

Dalinar uses some firemoss to escape his quiet life with no battles or fighting. [[Havar]] and [[Bashin]] are with him and place bets on the wrestling match. Dalinar watches the match and begins to feel excited at the conflict, then he remembers that that almost led him to kill Gavilar. Havar asks when they are going to the Rift to fight the rebellious [[Tanalan]], but Gavilar is trying diplomatic means. The feature match has been canceled due to one participant being sick, so Dalinar takes off his shirt and enters the ring. His opponent is the undefeated [[Makh]], but he backs out for fear of being hurt. Havar explains that Dalinar maimed some men in a tavern fight a couple of weeks back, so no one wants to face him. The den empties and Toh arrives, looking for Dalinar. He reports that Evi is giving birth.

Evi tells Dalinar that he has a son, and the midwives bring him in. He takes him in his arms and laughs in joy. He gives him a silent blessing: that he may inherit his strength and some of Evi's compassion. Looking at his son, he better understands Gavilar's thought for a stable future. He names him Adolin and is surprised to see Gavilar there. He congratulates Dalinar, but there is clearly something wrong, so they go apart to talk. Dalinar asks after Jasnah's "lunacy," but he says she's recovering. Instead, he's worried about the Rift, which is in true rebellion. Dalinar worries about going back to battle because he's an animal when he fights. Gavilar instead sends him to fight some other border disputes to show that they are determined to keep a united Alethkar.

Dalinar flies with Kaladin and some squires, Navani at his side. He marvels that Kaladin has enough control to fly at the edge of a highstorm, and the Stormfather speaks up, perceiving that he is thinking of him. Kaladin then touches all of them, and they all slow to stop, hanging in the air above warcamps. They take in the view, then Kaladin touches them all again, bringing them gently to the ground. The guard hurries them inside the camp, as the Parshendi have been seen nearby, and Dalinar gets a tour of his warcamp from [[Jasalai]], the scribe left in charge. After a meal, Navani talks with [[Rushu]] about a proposed flying ship of some kind. The spanreed for Queen Fen starts blinking, and she says "yes" to visiting Urithiru. She had visited the Aharietiam vision on her own that morning. They make arrangements and Dalinar leaves the room. He wanders around the monastery and runs into Kadash. He tells him he's looking for the madman that was housed here. Kadash tells him which building and asks Dalinar if he really thinks he was a Herald. Dalinar believes it likely and asks him if he would accept his word if he agreed with Dalinar's heretical claims. Kadash would find it hard to change. He spies one of his spanreeds, which has just finished writing. It is from the Palanaeum, where scribes are using the Dawnchant clues Dalinar got from the visions. Dalinar exults that he believes that the visions are true, but Kadash is skeptical of the source. Dalinar goes to room 37, the madman's room, which is locked. He asks the Stormfather if he can use his powers, but they won't work here. He finally goes outside and sees a hole already cut out by a Shardblade in the outside wall. He searches the room and finds a dart. Kaladin arrives and identifies Blackbane poison on the tip. As they gather and leave the warcamp, Dalinar orders Kaladin to fly to Thaylen City in the next highstorm.

;Plot Summary
'''Moash'''

Moash and the other parshmen have been pulling the sledge for a few days on their way to [[Kholinar]]. They stop to rest in an orchard and Moash sees some of the Fused on horseback and not flying. He then comments to the parshmen that he's surprised the Fused have not just swept in and destroyed everything in their path as the legends have told. That the Fused are actually farming. Moash mentions in passing that he killed one of the Fused and Sah is baffled. The company heads out again and stops in a town nearby. Moash sees the Fused sending humans too weak to work in the fields to Kholinar. He realizes that the Fused are trying to overcrowd the city with refugees. Moash also realizes that they have stopped in this town for the siege because a highstorm would destroy an army on the plains. He and the punished parshmen are brought to a lumberyard to build siege ladders to use on Kholinar's walls. When the overseer sneers at him that he'll be in the front running the ladder towards Kholinar and the archers, Moash is overcome with laughter at the irony. 

'''Shallan'''

Shallan reads another letter from Mraize. He tells her that Ishnah was an assistant to real spies, but not a threat and may continue to work for Shallan. While she waits for a meeting with Elhokar she examines the illusion she has placed on her pouch that makes it appear violet, but is actually white. The illusion is being sustained by the Stormlight of a sphere in the pouch, rather than by Stormlight from inside her. She ponders new applications of this ability. Shallan then meets with Elhokar. She tells him she's going to fly with Kaladin to Thaylen City. Then, in private, she offers the king her and her spies' company on the mission to Kholinar. Elhokar at first hesitates, not wanting to take two Radiants away from Dalinar. She convinces him that she is not Dalinar's subject and neither is he; he can do what he wishes. He accepts.

Shallan tucks the formal request to help into her safepouch next to Mraize's letter. She tries to convince herself that she's not just running away from Jasnah. Pattern is humming, and Shallan hums with him.

He realizes that he is glad the fighting has gone on for so long so he can continue feeling the Thrill. As he finally drifts off to sleep, he is woken by Evi's voice. She has been living in Kholinar for the past few years. At first he's angry that she's here, but she wants to be like the other Alethi wives and accompany her husband. She chides him for not visiting her more often; Renarin hasn't even met his father yet. Her healing touch calms him, and he goes to see his sons. Adolin is thrilled to see his father again and it is clear how much Adolin already looks up to Dalinar. Renarin is a toddler and merely looks at his father and plays with blades of grass. The Thrill finally leaves Dalinar. He promises Evi that they will discuss her role there later, and she leads him to a bed in her wagon to sleep.

;Plot Summary
Jasnah ponders her recent readings about the history of Jah Keved. She is disturbed by the account of an ancient king slaughtering his entire family and court after many assassination attempts. She peeks into the library, now full of scholars. The hallway in which the Unmade had fled had been discovered to lead to an alternate exit into the mountains. Renarin is there, watching the scholars in his Bridge Four uniform. Jasnah worries about rebellion within the family, like the story about the king who ruled for only three months. She sees her spanreed light up, and she speaks to some fellow colleagues, Jochi and Ethid, via Tashikk. They report that they suspect that the Herald Nale has been seen. They relate the tale of Lift and Nale in the palace. Jasnah notices Navani talking to Shallan and goes over to them. Renarin looks strange. Suddenly, Amaram shows up in the doorway. He asks Jasnah to speak in private, but she declines, taking the opportunity to insult him. He was apparently Gavilar's choice for Jasnah's husband, and he tries to "rekindle" the relationship, which Jasnah insists never existed. She further insults him and his mother, implying she was a whore, and he starts to summon his blade. She smiles and dares him to continue, showing Stormlight leaking from her hand. He storms off and Shallan giddily congratulates her on being so clever. She then asks for permission to leave, saying that Elhokar needs her in case they have to sneak into the city. Jasnah wants to speak to Elhokar about that, then she suddenly notices that Renarin has opened a drawer with a strange gemstone inside. Shallan notices that it seems to buzz with a musical language. Renarin pushes Stormlight into the wall and hundreds of drawers open. The contents of the [[Urithiru_gem_archive|library]] have been preserved in the gems.

;Plot Summary
Moash works on the ladders for the siege. Sah and Khen are resentful at their treatment, but don't know what to do about it. Their own gods have set them up to die in the first assault. Moash is also frustrated at their plight, knowing what it's like to be sent in to absorb arrows, and walks off into the town, demanding to talk to someone in charge. One of the flying Fused approaches and says he can talk to [[Leshwi|Lady Leshwi]]. It tows him up to the sky and leaves him hanging there. He floats over to Leshwi, and she asks him how he got his name, because "Moash" is a Parshendi name of old. She says that she is one of the "sane" Fused, so is the one in charge. He was spared because he showed such passion in fighting her (she was the one he had killed during his capture) and in helping the lesser Singers. He admits that he doesn't deserve the Shards that were taken from him, and also opines that the humans don't deserve to rule. He only wants vengeance.

Later, he wanders the streets, set free by Leshwi. He ponders on the Fused, being reborn for thousands of years and never giving up. He goes back to the lumberyard and finds his forlorn crew. He offers to teach them the spear.

;Plot Summary
Rlain attunes to the Rhythm of the Lost as he watches the Alethi soldiers repurpose his old home, Narak. As far as he knows, he is the only true listener left. He is trusted enough to hold a spear, but not enough to hold Stormlight. Even the newcomer Lyn seems more part of the group than he is. He goes over to the drink station where some bridgemen are discussing a recent raid by the Fused on a caravan. They ask Rlain what they're up to -- since he would know since they're his kin -- and he explains that the Fused are not his people. His people had tried to avoid them, and somehow they were tricked into bringing the Fused back. Kaladin and the rest of the patrols return, and they gather to drink Rock's latest concoction. They are uncomfortable with Renarin hanging out with the scholars, as it is too feminine, but have no trouble with Drehy courting a man, which confuses Kaladin. Rlain sympathizes; humans can't simply choose a form and act accordingly. Kaladin sends the men off for more training and offers the rest of the day off for Rlain, noticing his frustration. Rlain complains that Kaladin doesn't really know how he feels, so Kaladin offers to listen.

Dalinar brings Navani and Jasnah into the Recreance vision without the aid of a highstorm. They try to figure out the time period by observing the weapons and architecture. Yanagawn has been brought into the vision as well, and he watches the Knights abandon their shards with interest. Dalinar feels the pain of the dying spren. Yanagawn shares his doubts about his own abilities; he is just a youth, placed on the throne because the viziers feared the Assassin in White. Dalinar again asks him to come to Urithiru. As usual, the Almighty gives the final speech associated with the vision, then Yanagawn fades away, but the vision does not. Dalinar calls for the Stormfather, but there is no answer. Turning about, he sees a man in white and gold clothing holding a golden scepter. Thinking that the Almighty (Honor) has appeared to him, he kneels. The man identifies himself as Odium.

;Plot Summary
Odium settles down for a chat while Dalinar practically panics. He calls Odium a monster for killing Honor, but he retorts that Dalinar has behaved similarly in his life. Odium states his intention to kill Cultivation as well, but he can't right now because he is shackled. Dalinar suggests that he just go away and leave them alone. Odium asks if that's a serious offer made with [[Intention|Intent]], and Dalinar asks why he can't just leave without killing. Odium uses examples from Dalinar's own campaigns; he has enemies to destroy, whether they are worthy of death or not. He explains that he is the god of passion, not just hate, and that he cares for people, unlike Honor and Cultivation, being only interested in oaths and transformation, good or bad. Dalinar asks why the Knights abandoned their oaths, but he doesn't answer directly. He starts to walk away, and Dalinar offers a challenge of champions. Odium declines to take that risk, confident that Dalinar will release him anyway. Dalinar tells him that he's not afraid of him anymore now that he has revealed himself. Odium smiles and plunges him into a vision of sorts, allowing Dalinar to experience Odium's true depth of power; the old man is just a mask. Dalinar is overwhelmed by the intense emotions he experiences and shrinks from the vision. Odium kindly tells him to rest then suddenly frowns, looking among the rocks. He disappears and Lift emerges. She agrees to come to Urithiru as long as the food is good. The vision finally fades.

[[Kaza]] clings to the rigging as the ''[[First Dreams]]'' heads directly into a storm. After one last enormous wave, the storm suddenly stops, and [[Vazrmeb]] exults that forbidden treasure will soon be theirs. He takes the helm from [[Droz]], who ignores Kaza's deformed appearance and starts to chat with her. She struggles to converse because she is forgetting how humans interact. The captain orders her to soulcast some of the stone spikes so they can approach the island in dinghies. She promises to comply but reminds him that she is here for her own purposes. They board four dinghies, and she begins to soulcast one of the spikes. In the midst of convincing the stone to turn into smoke, she almost turns herself into smoke to finally end her pain. Vazrmeb climbs into her dingy while the one he was in heads back; the men claim to be ill. She begins to feel slightly sick herself and a moment later notices that all of the sailors have collapsed. She determinedly grabs the oars herself and struggles to the shore, where she collapses, feeling sleepy. She crawls a bit further, passing an uncut gemstone among the remains of a greatshell, then collapses again. The cook appears behind her, and Kaza realizes they have all been poisoned. She asks what the secret of the island is, but the cook refuses to answer as even her soul could reveal the secret that would be "the ends of worlds." The cook's [[Dysian Aimian]] body collapses and some cremlings try to take the soulcaster from Kaza. She turns the ground beneath her and herself to smoke.

Taravangian knows he is brilliant today and impatiently works the math problems. Only one problem eludes him; he is not quite at the level as the day he created the [[Diagram (literature)|Diagram]]. He orders that his rooms be cleared of furniture and people and orders some background music. Adrotagia brings him a copy of the Diagram, and he settles down with the transcribed copy. He starts cutting it to pieces; the Diagram in this form might be misleading them, so he decides he needs to separate it back into its parts to see it in new ways. He connects different parts of the text and gains new insights. He notices a slip of paper under the door -- the measurements of the field outside his window he had ordered earlier. He opens the door and orders gum paste so he can start putting paper up on the wall. He fears that Adrotagia suspects that he pretended to be less intelligent, and he is right. She confronts him on the problem he skipped -- a ruse to allow him to make decisions. He deflects the conversation by sharing his calculations on how much food Urithiru could produce, based on the size of the field outside. They must have been able to grow food inside. She insists that he follow his own rules, and he impatiently agrees to make no more policy decisions for the day and kicks her out of the room. He tries to figure out a contingency for the failed assassination of Dalinar. He reads again the words the surgeon uttered at his birth. He had feared that since the cord was around his neck that he would have diminished capacity, which while not true, had become his reputation. After working for hours, a maid brings in food, and Adrotagia and Mrall check up on him. He has changed the Diagram such that it now directs them to support Dalinar then topple him, taking his place. They can use Malata's spren as a spy to find his weaknesses. Taravangian concludes that they cannot defeat Odium. He has been given the capacity to "save whatever they can."

She hears a kindly voice intervene, saying, "this one is mine." Something else enters. The storm subsides and Venli looks at her new form, which is less muscular, unlike the other eight. They start speaking in another language. Some act insane. Demid does not recognize her and treats her with derision. Ulim pulls her aside and explains that her companions are now Fused, inhabited by the souls of their gods. Demid has been replaced with [[Hariel]], a notoriously vicious Fused. She pleads with Hariel to bring Demid back, but not even Odium could do so. He praises Venli for her perseverance in the war against the humans and tells her that Odium has a special purpose for her. She sits and waits while the Fused talk together in a strange language, and she sees the ball of light again, like the one near Eshonai's body. She instinctively hides it from the Fused.

Kaladin reports that flying with the highstorm will work for the team's transport to Kholinar. Dalinar tells him that now that he is a shardbearer, he has been gifted lands by the king. Kaladin doesn't like the idea of that responsibility but is reminded that he took that upon himself by speaking the Words. Malata brings them to Thaylen City after some calculations by Navani.

Fen brings them to the temple of [[Shalash]]. Dalinar wonders how the storm destroyed some of the faces of the statues inside the temple. They proceed to the temple of [[Battah]] at which a large statue has collapsed. The temple is filled with wounded since the hospitals are overrun. Taravangian pleads that she allow his surgeons to come to help, and she accepts. She insists that they can rebuild, but they lack labor since the parshmen left. Dalinar again offers the assistance of his troops. Fen doesn't respond, but her troops seem displeased, especially one who appears to be her son. They decide to skip to the end of the tour at the courtyard of Talenalet for some refreshments. Fen leaves them for a while on the pretense of attending to other business, so Dalinar takes the opportunity to make a display. He baits the man he supposes to be her son, and he demands a duel for the insult. He proposes an uneven match in which each has a sword and the other unarmed, each turn taking three minutes. First blood wins. Dalinar is first to go unarmed and manages to avoid being hit until 10 seconds remain, then he intentionally steps into his opponent's thrust. He heals himself with Stormlight and concedes the duel as the soldiers look on in amazement and fear. He suddenly regrets the stunt as unbecoming of Knight Radiant. He goes off to brood alone and rests against the broken walls of the temple. He hears many voices begging him to unite them, and he realizes the voices come from the wounded stones of the temple. He fills himself with all the Stormlight he has with him and heals the front wall of the temple. He tells a nearby scribe to send for Renarin.

Fen finds Dalinar back at the temple of Battah, repairing the broken statue. Fen's son [[Kmakl]] and the other soldiers enthusiastically help, fetching missing body parts. Renarin is there healing. Dalinar once again asks for Fen to join him. She agrees to lend aid, but he insists that they join together as a coalition. She agrees and promises to help bring in the Azish as well.

The team spends the night camped "inside" an illusion about a mile from the city. The Parshendi are allowing refugees in to drain the city of resources. Shallan disguises Kaladin and Adolin as old men -- Kaladin is ugly and wizened, Adolin is lean and attractive. She tells Elhokar that he'll be a woman, and he accepts without argument, being impatient to get into the city. They begin to walk in and he catches up to Kaladin. Elhokar expresses his doubts about his own abilities and charges Kaladin to get his wife and son out through the Oathgate. He falls back to the others and Adolin approaches. He thinks they should hide and gather information rather than approach the palace directly. Adolin knows of a place near the palace, but not too close. As they approach the side door of the city, they see that it is being blocked by soldiers now. Elhokar struts to the gate and demands entry. The captain explains that the city is packed and that they are only allowed a certain number into the city each day under order from Highmarshal [[Azure]]. They offer them entrance if they can conscript Drehy and Skar. Syl suddenly zips away and a group of Voidbringers are seen in the sky. The soldiers run off to engage them, and the refugees take the opportunity to rush into the city. Kaladin feels like he should help in the fight -- as he is commissioned to protect -- but Adolin convinces him that it's only a raid to test the defenses. Kaladin reluctantly follows him in, and indeed the raid ends quickly. They enter the crowded city and make their way toward the safehouse. An odd procession of performers dressed as spren pass by. A refugee holding a baby attracts exhaustionspren, but they look wrong. Syl says they are from "him" and they hurry away. They go through a courtyard and Adolin knocks on the back door of his tailor. After Shallan removes his disguise, they invite them in.

Shallan tries to draw out some painspren by punching herself, but she can't bring herself to do it hard enough. The others are sitting in the showroom, [[Yokska]] updating the king on the erratic behavior of his wife. Shallan spies some scissors and stabs herself, bringing the painspren. They are twisted, monster-like, and green instead of orange. Elhokar blames his wife's behavior on the "dark spren" that came after the Everstorm. Shallan continues to sketch as she listens. She draws a hungerspren she'd seen earlier, but it had looked normal. The tailor tells them that the queen had ordered the execution of the parshmen, but the order was blocked by important lighteyes in the city. They were eventually exiled outside the city by the Wall Guard. Meanwhile, Shallan tries to think of something really embarrassing, and she unbuttons her safehand sleeve. During a pause in the conversation, she trips and sprawls out on the floor, showing her legs and exposed safehand. Shamespren appear, also altered from their normal form. She scurries off to draw them. Yokska continues: a new highmarshal of the Wall Guard arrived and restored order, but they mostly just guard the wall, leaving the [[Cult of Moments]] to rule the city. Use of any type of fabrial attracts screaming yellow spren, which draw some Fused who then confiscate the fabrial. Kaladin presses her for more information, but Shallan perceives that she is overwhelmed, so she is dismissed to rest. Elhokar is determined to stay and do something to save the city and his family. They decide to stay and at least scout out the city. Elhokar will send a message to his wife at the palace via Shallan, disguised as a message girl. Kaladin is to accompany her in case of emergency. Shallan goes to her room to change into Veil. Since she obviously wasn't with them, Shallan is forced to reveal the truth to her guards.

She wanders for some time, eventually getting closer to the palace, where the feeling of wrongness returns. She disguises herself as Lyn (while still remaining Veil) and approaches the oathgate. It is guarded by cultists. She hears strange sounds, like screams, coming from the platform. She finds Kaladin and he gives her the king's letter. He points out that the guards are acting strangely -- they are standing completely still, like statues. Veil tells Kaladin to stay there while she delivers the letter so they both aren't entrapped. She climbs the steps to the palace and announces that she has a letter from the Shattered Plains for the queen. The captain takes the letter from her, and she protests that she is supposed to deliver it personally, when one of the guards stabs her with a sword. She collapses to the floor and the captain simply returns to his post. She pretends to die, but uses just enough Stormlight to stay alive. A guard slings her over his shoulder and carries her away. As she's carried through the hall, she passes a mirror, in which she sees a shadowy figure with white eyes look in surprise at her. She's deposited in a room with a few other rotting corpses. She slips out of the room and disguises herself as a servant. She finds a door leading out and has Pattern check for guards. There are two outside, so she has Pattern imitate the voice of their captain, calling them. They walk away. She exits the palace and hides by a nearby building, telling Pattern to fetch Kaladin.

Dalinar fetches [[Jezrien]]'s honorblade. He asks the Stormfather if he knows where the Heralds are, and at first he evades the question. He reveals that he knows where Ishar is, and Dalinar figures out that he's [[Tezim]]. Stormfather explains that Dalinar has the powers of Ishar, Binder of the Gods, the power of [[Connection]]. Only two others can have his powers -- powers that come from his "siblings." Dalinar asks him if he can infuse a sphere, and the Stormfather tries, but fails. Dalinar gives the honorblade to Bridge Four so they can practice while Kaladin is gone.

Navani and Fen prepare Dalinar for his visit to the Azish, which he feels he should do alone, despite the risk. As he walks to the Oathgate, he encounters a training exercise between Sadeas's and Aladar's troops which is getting out of hand. He shouts them down and uses Adhesion to stop the fighting. Aladar's men make an orderly retreat, but Sadeas's troops are sullen and angry. He meets Jasnah at the Oathgate where they decide to send them to Thaylenah to help with the restoration efforts to keep them busy. She sends him to Azir.

He can now understand and speak Azish. The lead vizier, Noura, is impressed that he has learned their language, but is about to dismiss him anyway. He proffers another essay, this time by Navani. She offers economic and technological benefits. He then gives them an essay by Jasnah. They are extremely impressed by the form of the writing, calling it a work of art. Dalinar persuades them to let him stay longer, and they agree to talk to the Prime and his council.

Dalinar is led to a small but comfortable room where he is to wait. He decides to eat some of the food sent with him, and he discovers that it's already eaten. Lift is there eating one of his sausages. He learns that she is an [[Order of Edgedancers|Edgedancer]], and she perceives that he's been to see the Nightwatcher because he "smells" like her. They eat quietly together for a while until Noura returns. They have accepted his offer of a visit to Urithiru. Several dignitaries and bureaucrats will be coming. Dalinar thanks her and is escorted back to the Oathgate. Noura expresses surprise at Dalinar's approach, saying that she instead expected an "animal" of war and blood. This triggers a memory in Dalinar, and after he is transported back he suddenly remembers everything about the Rift.

;Plot Summary
:''Eleven years ago''
Dalinar discusses strategy with his son Adolin, now twelve years old, inside a newly conquered keep in the highlands near Jah Kaved. The fighting here is dying down, but he knows that the next target will be the Rift to quell another rebellion. Evi comes into the room and lets him know that Gavilar is sending a message via spanreed. Adolin is dismissed to attend to his studies. A messenger comes with the letter, and Evi reads it aloud. Gavilar informs him that a treaty has been signed and congratulates him on his accomplishments in the field. He is held in high esteem by the king's generals. He instructs Dalinar to proceed to the Rift to address the rebellion of [[Tanalan]], just as he expected. Evi is distraught that he's going onto yet another campaign and scolds him for not ever being with Renarin, the son that he almost forgets about because of his disability. He tells her that they will probably never settle in Kholinar, and she starts crying. Dalinar is surprised -- he thought she was growing comfortable with the other women. He offers to take her to her homeland, but she is in exile from her own people -- they would attack. He finally concedes to go back to Kholinar for at least one year after the Rift.

;Plot Summary
Shallan has mostly recovered a day after being "murdered" in the palace, though she is still bothered by the Unmade that she saw in the mirror. She, Adolin, Kaladin, and Elhokar hold a meeting in Yokska's kitchen while the building's owners are out buying food. Elhokar decides that Shallan will infiltrate the Cult of Moments to get close to the Oathgate, and he and Adolin will rally the lighteyed houses in the city to assault the palace if she fails. Meanwhile, Kaladin is to investigate Azure and the Wall Guard. Adolin compliments Elhokar on his plan, but he points out that Aesudan's bizarre behavior started before the Everstorm. Elhokar insists that something must have gone wrong -- she was proud but never gluttonous. He asks for their thoughts on the plan, and they agree to proceed.

Shallan, as Veil, walks on the streets in disguise, trying to get a feel for the city's atmosphere. She notes that the market is quieter than it normally would be, due to everyone feeling like they are under siege. She stops to chat with a woman in a tailor's stall, finding out more about the current situation. Some order is still kept by Velalant's soldiers. Veil finds grain being distributed at a former Thaylen bank called [[Secure Keeps]]. Velalant's soldiers appear disorganized, allowing some to get in line more than once. She gives a stick of meat to an urchin, then asks him some questions regarding the food line. She learns that the soldiers seem to be purposely excluding many of the poor while giving food to servants of wealthier lighteyes. She tries to find out more by giving the boy another stick of meat, but he has run off. The line closes, to the ire of the poor who haven't gotten food. She is frustrated and wishes she could do something for them. She turns to leave, but then hears a familiar voice. She approaches it and sees Wit telling a story about the moon [[Mishim]]. After he finishes the story, the gathered people plead for more, but he refuses to say more. Soon only he and Veil are left. She spies a sealed jar in his pack, which he quickly shuts, then offers to let her buy him some food.

He leads her to an inn and they are admitted to a private dining area. Wit compliments Shallan on her disguise. She probes him for information on who he is, suspecting that he's a Herald. He claims to be much older than them. Shallan looks into his eyes and sees eons of time passing. He has made a vow to be "there" when he is needed. They banter, and it comes out that Sadeas has been murdered. Wit is disappointed that he wasn't around for that. He does know that he needs to be in the city, but doesn't know why. The innkeeper brings some food, and Shallan eats while Wit seems distracted. She tells him that she wants to be like him, to be able to change the world. He cautions her to be careful with power and to be wary of anyone who claims to see the future. She asks him about the cult on the Oathgate platform. The Unmade known as the [[Ashertmarn|Heart of the Revel]] is there, and every night the members feast. If she can obtain non-soulcast food, she may be able to join the party. Wit makes an abrupt exit, and she asks Pattern if he knows who Wit is, and he says that he feels like one of them.

;Plot Summary
Kaladin lashes a small stone with a tiny bit of Stormlight. The inhuman screeching starts soon after. He exhales the rest of his Stormlight and mixes in with the crowd in the plaza. Shallan and Adolin are there with him to observe. The spren look confused, unable to pinpoint the location of the Surgebinding. A Fused shows up and appears to scold them. The spren disappear and the Fused stays a bit longer, eventually leaving. They return to the tailor shop.

Kaladin gripes about the lighteyes having parties while the city is besieged, and Skar and Drehy point out that darkeyes have dances during war. Adolin enters the room, beaming at his new outfit provided by Yokska. Elhokar also arrives, eager to get on with the business at hand, and calls for disguises. Kaladin refuses a new face, but the king insists on at least covering up his slave brands. They all head out into the city, Adolin chatting with Skar and Drehy. Kaladin hangs back a bit, and Adolin joins him. Kaladin regrets not bringing a spear with him, and Adolin tries to persuade him to train more with the sword since he won't know what he'll face as a Radiant. Kaladin agrees and decides that Adolin is a good person despite his silly outfits. They arrive at the house with the party. Elhokar and Adolin will seek out lighteyed allies in the party proper, Skar and Drehy will try to gather intelligence in the darkeyed feast, and Kaladin will try to find out about Highmarshal Azure in the lower-ranked lighteyed section. They split up, and Kaladin decides to continue to the wall itself and come back later. On the way, he is stopped by a wall guard patrol and offered a meal, despite his slave brand which has strangely defeated the disguise. Kaladin accepts, hoping to learn more about the wall guard.

;Plot Summary
Kaladin sits down in the barracks and immediately feels at home. The lieutenant who brought him in, [[Noromin|Noro]], asks him for his story as he's given a bowl of stew. Kaladin gives some information but holds back on the whole story. Noro continues his recruiting effort but doesn't press too hard. Kaladin notices that everyone in the room is a lighteyes, and it finally hits home that plenty of them are just regular people. The men tell him about Azure, how Azure rallied the troops against the Cult of Moments. Azure used some sort of Shardblade and the men felt like they had Spren helping them. Azure enters to make the normal rounds for the evening, and Kaladin sees that she is very obviously a female. She greets Kaladin and encourages him to join -- they always have food. Kaladin is still reluctant, so Azure takes him out to look at the wall.

Azure leads Kaladin up onto the wall. As they walk, Azure guesses that Kaladin wound up in Sadeas's border army rather than on the Shattered Plains, so she doesn't blame him for deserting. Azure says she won't press Kaladin into the guard, but that at least with them, he'll have a chance at defending the city and turning back the Voidbringers. Kaladin leaves them and goes back to the mansion to chat with the lighteyes there, but he doesn't find out anything. Kaladin's brands are fully visible even though his sphere is still infused. Elhokar and Adolin join Kaladin (their illusions still intact), and Kaladin reports that he may have found another Radiant.

Dalinar marches toward the Rift from the west while Sadeas's forces march in from the east. He rides behind Evi's wagon, where she continually burns incense and glyphs. He regrets their earlier exchange and decides to join her. She begs him to try to avoid bloodshed. She sees a great man, but he becomes a bloodthirsty monster in battle with a terrible empty look in his eyes (i.e. when he's taken with the Thrill). The carriage stops and he receives Teleb's report. A caravan was observed leaving the city, but they did not engage it. He commands the troops to form up and goes alone toward the city wall. Tanalan eventually comes out to talk to him. Dalinar tries to convince him to surrender, or at least try to reduce bloodshed by having a duel decide the battle. Tanalan declines, knowing he'd probably lose, but does propose the idea that they can pretend that they were allies in secret so that disloyal highprinces could be rooted out (because they would join Tanalan's supposed rebellion). He says that Sadeas was the one in the caravan. Dalinar rides back, and Teleb reports that someone with Shardplate is in the caravan. Dalinar decides that he can't risk sending conventional troops against someone with shards, so he must go with them. He tells Evi to send a message to Gavilar, that the Rift may be taken without bloodshed, and to trust no one.

Veil and Vathah sneak into a mansion, following Red, who is already inside and runs reconnaissance. They pass a series of waterfalls soulcast into different materials. They pass Ishnah, disguised as a rug merchant, talking with Brightness [[Nananav]] regarding a replacement rug. They duck into a room to avoid guards, and Shallan draws her memory of Nananav. She creates a diversion for the guards and emerges from the room as Nananav. She concentrates on getting into character, adopting an attitude of arrogance to the point of feeling utter disdain for her team members. She pulls back and proceeds to the storeroom where she sees a master servant. She berates and punishes him for an insufficient bow and demands he unlock the door. They enter, and Vathah starts gathering sausages into a sack. She starts contemplating murdering the "inferior" version of Nananav and replacing her, so she drops the disguise, shaken. They load the sacks on a dumbwaiter and hurry out. They load the food on the wagon, and Veil spots some angerspren coming from the direction of the larder. They beat the chull into movement, but Nananav catches up to them yelling for guards. Veil stands up in the wagon and puts on the Nananav disguise. The real Nananav screams and runs away, but a crossbow bolt takes "Nananav" in the head. She appears to melt away, frightening away the guards. She changes back to Veil and passes out when Vathah pulls the bolt free. After coming to, completely healed, she decides to head to the market first to give some food to her urchin contact, Grund. She asks him about the book she wants (for information on The Heart of the Revel), but he has nothing for her. She asks who else could use some food, and he suggests several people. She goes around delivering all the food to get the Cult's attention.

;Plot Summary
Kaladin is on patrol along the inside of the wall. He's been assigned to Noro's squad. The men chat amiably; Kaladin has been easily accepted into the group by the others. They see some noble dressed in a ridiculous outfit and make jokes about him. It turns out to be Adolin, who gives a subtle signal to Kaladin to stay with the guard. As they talk, Kaladin learns that even among lighteyes there are distinct castes. Those of the lower dahns call those of the higher dahns "middlers" and do not associate with them. They eventually meet up with some other squads to guard Velalant's food wagon. The starving refugees get increasingly hostile, but fortunately Velalant's guards show up and push back the crowds. Noro's squad is assigned to the wall in half an hour, and Kaladin and [[Beard]] climb to the station. Kaladin asks him how they are getting food. The only clue is that Azure had them attack a monastery that has a soulcaster, but they don't know why the screamers don't give it away. They reach the top of the wall, and Kaladin notices that the portion near the palace is lightly patrolled. Beard says that they hear whispers to join the palace guard when they go near there; Azure has told them to not listen, and they won't get sucked in. As the rest of the squad arrives, alarm drums sound. Kaladin starts giving orders, then feels stupid because he's not in command. They form a pike block and see the Fused engaging other troops some distance away. Some men start to break out of formation to go help, and Kaladin has to hold his tongue until Noro finally says something. The assault is very brief and never gets to them. Kaladin apologizes to Noro, but Noro doesn't seem to mind.

;Plot Summary

Veil makes her usual rounds, giving food to Grund and Muri. She is gaining a reputation as a "Swiftspren," a spren robbing the rich and giving the food to the poor. She enhances this reputation by sending Ishnah and Vathah, wearing illusions, to look like Veil. She notices a Cult of Moments procession and joins them, creating an illusion shaped like the one she saw on the ''Wind's Pleasure''. She gets caught up in the chanting but is jarred by a voice in her mind saying "Shallan, I'm not your enemy." She breaks free and, continuing under the illusion of a spren, tells the cultists to stop worshiping spren and go home. Shaken, she realizes that she wants to be a hero too much and it stops her from being logical like Jasnah. She hears genuine laughter and goes toward it, finding Wit leading people in song. She heads back to the tailor's shop.

She struggles to return as Shallan because Veil wants to go flirt with Kaladin. She finds Elhokar sipping wine in the kitchen. He recognizes the pattern on her dress and idly asks about it. He confides that he also desires to be a hero. Shallan sketches an image of what Elhokar could be, noble and regal, which nearly brings him to tears. As she goes upstairs, Ishnah hands her a note securing her access to a feast at the palace.

A landslide wipes out his troops and nearly shatters his shardplate. He crawls from the rubble, the Thrill engulfing him. The eyes of the soldiers surrounding him seem to glow with the Thrill, and they attack.

The battle consumes Dalinar, and when he regains his senses, he's smashing the head of a man repeatedly, surrounded by corpses. Badly wounded and plate heavily damaged, he trudges back to his camp. The men there are astounded at his return, having received the message that all were dead. Dalinar realizes it was all a trap from the start. The scouts who relayed that a caravan left were traitors. Sadeas and Dalinar don't want to besiege the city; they want all the inhabitants to be punished - men, women, and children. Evi tries to pacify Dalinar, but he orders the soulcaster to make as much oil as possible. He intends to burn the entire town for their broken oaths.

Dalinar can't sleep, being consumed with the Thrill. He hardly even feels pain, or anything else besides a burning deep down. Messengers emerge from the city bearing a flag of truce. He orders that they be shot by the archers. Sadeas and Dalinar keep back messengers from the king so they can go forward with their plan and give Gavilar plausible deniability. Sadeas assures Dalinar that he does not want to be king and questions why Dalinar thought he had betrayed him. Dalinar admits that he once wanted to rule but realized that the man needed for this atrocity and the man to rule could not be the same person. They attack at night and secure a foothold on the wall. Dalinar orders the city to be burned. Teleb tries to convince him that innocents would die, but Sadeas retorts that this would eventually save lives in the future because there would be no more rebellion. Oil is dumped on the already flammable city and set ablaze. He leads Kadash to a saferoom on the outside of the city where he assumes Tanalan is hiding and sets it ablaze with barrels of oil. Walking away from the screaming within, he spots Tanalan trying to reach the palace instead. He pleads to Dalinar to let him save his family, but Dalinar (still bothered by the screams earlier in the saferoom) admits he is an animal and he will not be so foolish as to allow survivors again.  As the palace collapses, Tanalan's family dead, Dalinar decides it is enough and allows the remaining people to flee. As he moves to execute Tanalan, he comments that at least Tanalan didn't hide in that hole but he had set afire the people who were there. Tanalan laughs. The messengers that Dalinar killed at the start of the day were to tell him they had imprisoned his wife in the safehouse, which was now a prison since everyone knew about it. Dalinar strangles him to death in a fury. Kadash vomits at the realization of what they've done. Dalinar orders soldiers back to the hole, but the heat is too much. They are forced back, and Dalinar goes limp. 

Evi's burned corpse is brought back to camp. She had drugged her guard and snuck away in the night, leading people to suspect that she was a traitor. He swears the scribes to secrecy and instead has them hide her burned body.  They lie that she was assassinated in the night and the city was burned as retribution. As Dalinar leaves, he hears the screams of the innocent the night before and thinks he even hears Evi.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin rushes to a stormshelter for rich folk before the Everstorm hits. He meets with Shallan and Adolin to share information. Adolin shares that Elhokar is doing better than expected at convincing lighteyes to join him. Kaladin states that he thinks Captain Azure might have an honorblade. They definitely have a soulcaster and seized emerald stones in the city. Judging the state of Kaladin's issued sword, Adolin is impressed by her. Shallan has found information on the Unmade and believes there are two in the city: Sja-anat, the Taker of Secrets, and Ashertmarn, the Heart of Revel. The former corrupting spren and the latter leading people to indulge in excess. Shallan plans to infiltrate the palace that night. They all realize their dire situation as the city's fall is inevitable without the Oathgate open. Kaladin notices an odd cremling with a strange tan pattern on its back, suggestive of the Sleepless.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan and Adolin leave the wine house and walk through the streets arm in arm. Adolin complains that he hasn't seen any of her sketches for a while, so she hands him one of her sketchbooks. He is impressed with her drawings of the various refugees. He studies a sketch of himself in his new suit and Shallan takes the book back, knowing that the next drawing is of Kaladin. They part ways so she can steal some food as payment to the cult. Shallan changes into Veil and meets Vathah to go over the details of their food heist. The barkeep bursts into their room to try to figure out what they're up to, and Vathah unconsciously disguises himself with Stormlight. After the barkeep is dismissed, and he realizes what he has done and what he might be, he is brought to the verge of tears.

The woman disapproves of Vathah's presence and the fact that Veil reserved two bags of food to give to the poor instead of the cult. She remarks that Veil had been leaving rumors throughout the city that she wanted to join the cult, and Veil realizes that it was Wit's work. Veil tells them that she hears a voice telling her to give in to the end and embrace the "time of the spren", and the cult members allow her to enter.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin stands on top of the wall, observing the city after the Everstorm. He feels that things are wrong somehow. Beard and some of the others come up to call him in for dinner, and Kaladin joins them in the barracks. The platoon commanders call the men to muster, and Azure enters the room. She does a formal inspection, and Kaladin reflects on how these inspections are less about finding flaws and more of a chance for the men to show off. Azure compliments them as the "finest platoons" she's led, helping to boost morale. Kaladin sits at the officers' table, having been invited to sit there, but he is away from the center. When one of the captains excuses himself, he takes his seat.

'''Shallan'''

Veil steps up to the platform and meets her guide/guard, [[Kharat]]. He gives her a new name (Kishi) and leads her to the outer circle where there is a feast laid out. People mill about feasting with their bare hands, many with a glassy look to their eyes. Some go into the small monastery buildings to have sex. She tries to go into the inner circle so she can see the Oathgate, but Kharat holds her back; she's not allowed in there on her first visit. She hears the voice whispering in her mind to let go and enjoy. She drags him to an empty room so she can "rest" and uses Pattern's "voice" to lure him away momentarily for a drink. She leaves an illusion of herself and changes into "Kishi," modeled after a woman in the market, and heads into the inner circle as Kharat guards her illusory Veil.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin sits across from Azure and starts questioning her. He asks her why she's so cavalier with her Shardblade, hanging nearby on the wall. She probes him for his background as well, but dodges her questions. She tires of his hinting and asks him directly what he wants to know. He asks why everyone is pretending that she's not a woman, then she asks him if he was chasing after her. Before he can answer her curious question, the alarm sounds. The wall is under attack.

'''Shallan'''

The next ring in was full of people crawling about enthralled with various emotions. The food on the tables is rotten. She almost gives in to the desire to lose herself in the Revel, but Pattern's hum snaps her back. She heads to the control building and finds a dark mass covering it. She hears a different voice in her mind now, warning her of a trap. She looks down and sees her shadow pointing the wrong way, creeping up the wall. She hears the drums warning of the attack, and she scampers back to the outer circle and leaps off the platform.

;Plot Summary

Kaladin and Azure rush up the steps to the wall. Fused are attacking and have already killed or wounded many men on duty on the wall. Kaladin organizes a defense, but the Fused fly in from all directions, making it difficult to hold a formation. One Fused swoops down and Lashes Kaladin, trying to turn him into a weapon. He manages to "fall" into a guard house, avoiding hitting the soldiers. He leaps out of the room and grabs onto a Fused. He spirals up in the air, and Kaladin stabs him with a Syl-knife. They continue to struggle, twisting and turning in the air; the Fused is not affected by the wound. Syl tells him to go for the heart, so he thrusts upward, hitting something hard and brittle, and the Fused dies. They crash down back on the wall some fifty feet from where they started. Kaladin is forced to use Stormlight to heal. He reports to Azure and she points out that the entire army is coming. He reveals his Shardblade and says he's there on orders from the king to save the city.

Veil goes to distribute the remaining food to Grund and the others, too shaken from the experience at the Oathgate to go back to the shop. She gives some bread to Grund, who is acting odd. He takes a bite of the bread and tries to bluff her into staying. She promises to come back with more food and leaves him, walking through the market disguised as a guard. She circles back to Grund and hears thugs beating him. She scares them off but not before one of them bashes Grund in the head. She tries to tend to his wounds, but as she does, he reveals that he actually hates her because the "Grips" gang forced him to wait around for food and would just steal it from him. All of those who she thought she was helping hate her. Grund dies, and she rushes to Muri, who is escaping the area because the Grips are mad about something. She curses Shallan and leaves with her children. Shallan crumples to the floor in anguish.

Azure explains that a man (Wit/Hoid) came with some metal sheets that would block them from being discovered. Azure then demands to know how the king plans to save the city, and Kaladin explains the plan with the Oathgate, with the Alethi army waiting to be transported in.

Wit arrives and tells her that failures are a part of life and that she didn't deserve to have a horrible life. Using illusion, they experience the story of The Girl Who Looked Up. She finds steps on the other side of the wall and finds God's light, which she brings back over the wall dispelling the darkness. Wit insists that the world is terrible, but Shallan is not terrible because of it, but the world is better for her presence. He forms two illusions of Shallan, one who collapses on the floor, one who stands and lives on, forgiving herself. She walks back to the shop where Adolin is waiting for her, sick with worry. They embrace and she feels somewhat better. Suddenly an army approaches with Kaladin and Azure at its head. He announces to Elhokar that they are ready to attack.

Adolin freshens up after a long night of worrying. He summons his Shardblade and thanks it. He promises to use it for good. He returns to the others as they plan the assault on the palace. The Windrunners are tasked with getting the queen and Elhokar's son out. Shallan will try to distract the Fused and somehow defeat the Unmade blocking the Oathgate. They hear drums announcing the assault, and they march. As they arrive at the palace, a Thunderclast climbs up the city walls, sweeping men off the wall like cremlings. It hurls a boulder at them, and Kaladin flies up to it and Lashes back in its direction, missing it. Shallan and the Windrunners go off to fight the Fused; Azure and Adolin charge the palace with their small army. The tower guard retreats inside and closes the doors, but Adolin's and Elhokar's Shardblades cut through the doors and walls to allow them in. Azure cuts her way in as well, using her shorter blade to slice enemy spears. Adolin charges in with his Shardblade, cutting down dozens and breaking the defensive formation. The enemy regroups, blocking the eastern gallery. The noise outside has subsided; the parshmen have apparently broken through and will be heading to the palace. Azure orders her men forward to try to break through. Meanwhile, Adolin and Elhokar cut through a door locked from the outside and find "traitor" palace guards who wouldn't obey the queen. Adolin starts hearing a voice in his head that cuts to his soul, glorying in the sweet passion of the battle. Azure's men have finally broken the defenders, and after they retreat, Kaladin and his squires appear, glowing brilliantly, announcing that the gallery is secure. Elhokar leads a force up to the royal chambers to get his family; Kaladin goes with him. Shallan summons her Shardblade and proceeds toward the Oathgate platform. Adolin clears the enemy out with his Shardblade with some help from Skar. They reach the control room and see the Unmade. Shallan walks forward to engage it.

;Plot Summary

'''Kaladin'''

Elhokar charges up the stairs quickly, stringing out their small force. They encounter a platoon blocking the way. Elhokar tries to stir their memories of their king, trying to break them from the spell they seem to be under. They break ranks and retreat after hearing a voice. Syl reports that the queen is inside the royal chambers. They hear her singing and enter.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan approaches the wrong-looking purple heart. She tries to destroy it with her Shardblade, but it has no effect. She decides to try what she did before, and touches it with her hand. She is swept away.

'''Kaladin'''

The queen acts normally at first and says that Gavinor is off playing with friends. Syl tells Kaladin where he really is, in the room, and he heads that way. Elhokar tries to get the queen to come away with him from the evil influence in the palace, but she just calls him a fool. Meanwhile, Kaladin finds Gav huddling in a corner being attacked by strange red spren. He summons Syl and stabs one of them, seemingly killing it. Syl is confused that they may have killed a spren. The queen boasts of her "Radiants" in the palace and that she has bonded with ancient spren, something Gavilar hadn't discovered. Her eyes start glowing red. Elhokar gathers up his son and they flee the queen. She calls for her soldiers to attack.

'''Shallan'''

The spren implores Shallan to "give me your passion," and Shallan takes on many identities as the voices suggest different emotions. She hears Wit's voice tell her that she can be all of those people, and she screams to him for help. The darkness suddenly withdraws, and the enormous heart oozes away. Adolin and Azure prepare for the counter-assault with the army on the other end of the Oathgate. Shallan goes into the control room and sees a strange woman in the mirror. She introduces herself as Sja-anat.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin glows fiercely to try to hold back the queen's troops. It halts them momentarily, but they go forward again. Kaladin rushes down the steps and hears Parshendi singing. One of them is Sah, his friend.

'''Shallan'''

Sja-anat insists that she is not Shallan's enemy and that she is no longer of Odium. But she was compelled to mess with the spren controlling the Oathgate, creating a trap. She begs Shallan to not activate the device.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin sees friends on both sides, fighting and killing each other. He loses the will to fight and yells at them to stop. He sinks to his knees, distraught, then remembers that he needs to get Elhokar out. Kaladin sees Elhokar holding his son and the sketch of Elhokar that Shallan had done. Elhokar haltingly starts to say the Words, but is interrupted when Moash runs Elhokar through with a spear. Moash salutes Kaladin with the Bridge Four salute. The queen arrives surrounded by black smoke with strange crystal formations forming on her body. Drehy and Skar suddenly arrive and drive away the soldiers. Adolin pulls Kaladin away.

Kaladin and the Wall Guard make it to the platform, where Azure's soldiers are holding off the enemy. Adolin looks into the city and sees tens of thousands of parshmen in the city and Fused in the air readying to attack. He knows the city is lost and gives the order to abandon the city and escape to Urithiru. He goes into the control room and tells Shallan to activate the entire platform; they must escape. She's hesitating because Sja-anat told her that the Fused allowed them to get here to spring a trap. He tells her to activate it anyway.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan prepares to activate the Oathgate. Sja-anat realizes that they don't trust her and promises to try not to kill them. Shallan engages the Oathgate.

She returns to the town's mansion, where she is staying, and Rine derides her for being arrogant. Venli laments that the singers are so far behind, still stuck in Alethi customs. She suggests using human slaves to help speed up the work, but Rine tells her that they must kill all the humans to prevent them from manifesting Surgebinding. Venli returns to her room to pack and frees the spren from her pouch. It zips around and looks at various things in the room, pulsing to the rhythm of Curiosity. Venli realizes that she is attuning to the old rhythms, not the new ones of power, and tells the spren to go away. It pulses to Resolve and stays.

As the general explains, Sheler protests at his treatment, arguing that he was gathering resources because his homeland was under attack and demanding right of ransom, but he is told that ransom is not available since he was caught robbing and killing civilians. Sheler chooses the hog and is doused in foul-smelling oil. As an enormous claw breaks the surface of the ocean, he thinks that the "hog" may have been more of a nickname.

;Plot Summary
:''Eight years ago''
Dalinar attends a meeting with Gavilar and the heirs of the highprinces, acting as intimidation. He is still struggling with the events that occurred at the Rift three years ago. Since then, Gavilar (and Sadeas) have used the burning of the Rift as leverage to convince others to follow Gavilar's lead, with the implication that he can't control the Blackthorn and needs them to give him safer options by cooperating. Gavilar suggests that they light a fire in the hearth for warmth, which is a signal to Dalinar that he can leave since he can't stand the sight and sound of fire. He leaves the room, looking for alcohol to drive out the screaming he hears. As he walks down a corridor, he smells the incense Renarin is burning, reminding him of Evi. As he searches for wine in various places in the palace, Dalinar encounters Adolin with a group of soldiers, wearing a specifically tailored uniform. Adolin proudly tells him about setting up a bout with [[Tenathar]] and getting closer to winning a Shardblade. Dalinar scolds him for being too familiar with him while in uniform, but Adolin is not insulted; he merely tries harder and responds with a formal invitation to watch the duel. Adolin runs off, and Dalinar eventually must resort to the [[Beggars' Porch]] where he meets up with [[Ahu]], a crazy beggar who always seems to have something to drink. As they drink, Ahu (who is actually Jezrien) says strange things relating to various Desolations and being tortured. Afterwards, Dalinar drunkenly stumbles back to the wrong room and overhears a discussion between Gavilar, Elhokar, and Adolin about Dalinar's drinking. They're aware of all his attempts to find booze that evening and his visit to the Beggars' Porch. Their conversation brings memories of Evi back, so he stumbles off to his room and collapses on a couch.

;Plot Summary

'''Adolin'''

Adolin looks around at the strange landscape and the horrific creatures in the bead ocean and thinks he is in Damnation. Kaladin draws in Stormlight and goes airborne, trying desperately to get back to those he's trying to protect, but the spren feed on Stormlight, so they all start approaching the platform. Syl begs him to stop, and Kaladin drops back down. Azure explains to Adolin where they are, so Adolin starts to summon his blade. The spren with scratched out eyes starts screeching, so he abruptly stops. They feel a rumble beneath them, and a gargantuan spren, one of the Unmade, starts to rise from the depths. They decide to try to head for land, which here in Shadesmar would be the river nearby.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan is uncertain what she can do, and Pattern tells her she can't soulcast here. But she can touch a bead and form its shape in the physical realm using other beads. She practices with a shield, which holds Pattern's weight, but she needs something bigger. She asks the others to help find something, so they all start feeling around, only Adolin can't sense anything. She finally finds the control building, forms it of beads using Stormlight, and tells the others to jump on the roof, just above the surface. Then she forms a door on the other side, which they crowd onto, then forms the building again on the other side. As they slowly make their way from the city, Syl realizes that the Oathgate spren have been corrupted. Shallan knows that Sja-anat has kept her word in trying to not kill them.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin feels powerless. He sees that Kaladin is worse off and tries to encourage him. He is despondent that he was unable to protect his men and get them to stop fighting. Adolin manages to keep him talking as therapy even though Kaladin seems to know what he's doing. Adolin notices that Azure's hair is somehow losing its color, turning from black to gray. They finally reach the shore; everyone is exhausted. Kaladin wants to try to get back in the fight, but Adolin insists that they camp for the night. As he lays down on his makeshift bed, he realizes that he is now king.

Szeth is talking with sword-nimi at the [[Skybreaker]] fortress at the [[Purelake]]. It encourages Szeth to draw it more often, but Szeth has been warned only to draw in extreme emergencies and with lots of Stormlight on hand. He plans to finish his training and go back to Shinovar to administer justice. Ki tells Szeth and five other hopefuls that they are deemed worthy to speak the First Ideal of the [[Immortal Words]]. Instead of belting the words out like the others, Szeth whispers the First Ideal to the voices of the dead that he hears to assure them that they will receive justice for their murders. Ki then explains to them the procedure of becoming a full Skybreaker. They will undergo several tests and speak more ideals when a highspren is ready to bond to them. Before being carried through the air, Szeth asks Ki if he should be treated the same as the other new Skybreakers. She explains to him that only Nin, who is absent at that moment, is able to make such a judgement, and Szeth is content with this answer.

Kaladin remembers back to when he was in Amaram's army. He's being disciplined for freezing up during training. He chisels away at crem stuck on the bunker floor. Sergeant Tukks comes in to discuss it. He thinks that Kaladin was afraid of getting hurt, but Kaladin claims he was afraid of hurting someone else. Tukks suggests that he focus on his squadmates; they are like family, and he should worry about fighting for them. Kaladin isn't entirely truthful though -- he's actually worried about being an effective killer.

Back to the present, Kaladin broods while the others sleep. Syl comes over and sits next to him, resting her head on his arm. He asks her if she can get a message to Dalinar in the physical realm, but she doesn't think she can because her bond is to him, and he's in Shadesmar. Syl is very concerned about his mood and clings to him with both arms. The others start to awake.

The Skybreaker test is at the Purelake. Several convicts have escaped from a prison and all have a writ of death. [[Kwati]] runs the prison nearby, getting funding from the Reshis. Szeth finally sets out into the lake after all the other squires have left. Sword-nimi complains that he's behind because he hung around to ask questions about the situation. He walks along the bank and sees a tree with disturbed branches. He saunters past, pretending not to notice, hoping the criminal will stay hidden, but he leaps at Szeth with a dagger. Szeth notices how filthy and scrawny the man is. They grapple for a while, and Szeth disarms the man. He recovers the dagger, but then sees Nightblood and approaches it with lust in his eyes. He picks it up, then Szeth punches him and grabs the sword and whacks him on the back. The force of the blow paralyzes the man. A quick interrogation reveals that they escaped by killing the guard -- he knew it was foolish, but he was desperate to see the sun again. Szeth allows the man to drown. Next he goes to the prison and finds a filthy, poorly lit building with one dead guard. Szeth returns to the town and accuses Kwati of allowing terrible conditions at the prison and stealing the money meant to run the prison. He asks Ki if there is a writ of execution for him, and Ki replies that it's the first one they got. Szeth draws Nightblood and kills him, but he has insufficient Stormlight available. His arm is racked with pain and he hurriedly sheathes it. His arm has turned gray. He asks for some water.

Sword-nimi eventually becomes coherent and congratulates Szeth for drawing him. Vivenna had never done so. Ki returns with water and takes him as her squire. He recites the second ideal and is able to breathe in Stormlight again. He relishes returning to the skies.

Shallan informs them of their combined supplies, which isn't much.

They'll need to find a ship, sail to the perpendicularity, then travel from the Horneater Peaks. Kaladin is anxious to get back now to help in the fight. Suddenly, a screeching sound is heard.

Kaladin marches as quickly as possible; the spren still pursue. Pattern tells the humans to quell their emotions. Angerspren follow, and everyone claims to not be angry except for Kaladin. He feels like they are abandoning Kholinar, even though he knows it's not rational to try to go back. He keeps the anger more as an antidote to the darkness, the depression he feels when he fails. He tries to forget by examining the landscape as they walk. While doing so, he notices mostly black fernlike plants. The angerspren retreat.

They camp and walk for a couple of days. As they walk, Kaladin asks Syl where she lived. She lived in a grand city ruled by honorspren. She tells of another man she had bonded to. He was killed in a battle before the Recreance, so she survived, but she was broken. Her father found her and forbade her to leave the city again. She left anyway because she heard Kaladin calling to her. Suddenly she sees a light in the distance from a lighthouse.

Navani accompanies Dalinar to the first meeting of the coalition. He is very distant since his collapse and has asked her to conduct the meeting. All monarchs must bring their own chair to the meeting, an old Alethi custom. Bridge Four arrives with simple chairs and immediately begin partaking of the refreshments. They just laugh when it's suggested that Kaladin has perished. The other nobles arrive and sit down. Navani kicks off the meeting by pronouncing that this is a historic meeting, with so many diverse nations and interests counseling together. Various strategies are suggested. Some want to attack the parshmen, others are intrigued by the Oathgates and the implications to trade. Navani asks Taravangian about the development of half-shards, but he is too dense to explain anything. Ialai suggests that they attack Shinovar to gain access to its riches. The arguing intensifies, and Navani tries to bring the meeting back under control. She bows to the Yanagawn to quiet everyone down and suggests that they develop a code of laws and bureaucracy to meld the coalition. She suggests to Fen that she administer trade. She tries to give all the kingdoms a role based on their strengths. Regarding the war effort, Navani reveals that Alethkar has been overrun, and Jah Keved is probably next. Various kingdoms pledge troops to the effort to defend it. Navani calls for a pause in the meeting and sits by Dalinar. She suggests that he go somewhere for a change of scenery, and he agrees.

;Plot Summary

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin remembers back to when he was hiding in the underbrush with some other runaway slaves. They were safe for the moment, but the hunters were closing in, so they had to move. As they begin to walk, Nalma is caught in a steel trap and screams with pain. The hunters are alerted and they kill the scattering slaves. Kaladin stays with Nalma and vainly tries to treat her wounds. She dies, and the hunters arrive, sparing Kaladin so he can spread the word to other slaves that escaping is futile.

Kaladin uses his experience in scouting to sneak up on the lighthouse. He settles down to watch it for a bit, and anticipationspren crawl up from the beads and start waving their tongues like banners. Kaladin tries to kick them away, but they won't budge, so he merely continues forward. He peeks through a window and sees an old Shin man, reading by spherelight. He somehow senses Kaladin and calls out. Kaladin is forced to reveal himself.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan waits with the others behind a strange large mushroom. She tries to do some sketches, but Veil is seeping into her psyche, ruining her technique. Adolin gives her a shoulder rub and complains about having only one set of clothes to wear. Shallan is concerned about Kaladin, but Adolin says he'll be fine as long as he has an objective. A flying spren approaches; it looks like a gloryspren, but it's been corrupted.

'''Kaladin'''

The Shin man thinks that Kaladin is there for his fortune to be read, revealing a glowing crystal ball. Kaladin tells him he just wants passage with his friends. He's mesmerized by the strange light coming from the globe and reaches out and touches it. He is carried away by the approaching highstorm.

'''Shallan'''

The corrupted spren lands on Shallan's arm, and she hears the voice of Sja-anat. She warns Shallan that Odium has minions on this side that will hunt them. She lied to him and said that they were far away from the transfer point, but she fears that Odium doesn't trust her anymore. The spren flies off.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin sees swirling colors and racing clouds. He sees a vision of Dalinar in grave danger, surrounded by nine figures. Kaladin asks where he is, and he sees a vision of a city by the ocean. The vision fades. The fortune teller is amazed that he saw something and figures out that he is a Surgebinder.

Adolin and Shallan bargain with Riino for rations. They get some canned food and dig in. A ship will be coming soon that will take them to Celebrant, a city near the location of Rathalas in the Physical Realm. Kaladin asks Shallan for paper, and he draws the city he had seen in the vision. They all agree that it's Thaylen City. Kaladin wants to go to the Oathgate there and somehow use it to get there. Azure says the only way back is through the perpendicularity. A ship arrives.

Szeth and twenty other Skybreaker squires undergo a test of martial competence in the Purelake. Poles are set up with colored pouches attached to the top, and the squires are to fly between these poles while hitting others with the pouches and avoid getting hit themselves. At first Szeth does well, but he gets distracted when he realizes that he is enjoying himself, and he shouldn't be allowed to feel happy due to his past crimes. After blocking hits with a pole and using another squire as a shield, he gets surrounded by Ty's group and takes numerous hits. At that moment his Stormlight runs out and he falls in the water. He thinks he has lost the game, but when he sees two highspren impressed by him he understands that the rules state that points are deducted for marks on his uniform; it is washed clean in the water, so technically he has no points deducted. Warren and Ki like that Szeth has seen this loophole in the rules. Szeth is about to swear the Third Ideal of the [[Immortal Words]], but he is interrupted by the arrival of Nin. He must first share his two greatest secrets.

He goes over to Syl, who is wearing a lightweaving so she won't be recognized as an honorspren. She encourages him to go talk to Shallan. He goes over and looks through her sketchbook, noticing some strange drawings with childish technique.

;Plot Summary

Dalinar is in Vedenar, a city devastated by their civil war and the Everstorm, to survey their martial capabilities and fortifications. He has now regained almost all his memories, except for his meeting with the Nightwatcher. He is startled to hear the sounds of Evi crying and the cries of dying children again, and he worries for Elhokar's team. As Dalinar looks over the city's damage, Taravangian joins him, holding a giant kite shield containing a fabrial. The old king talks to him about choices and the paths they lead to, eventually concluding that morality and law are built on the bodies of the slain. He explains that fabrials are made by enslaving spren by luring them in with something they love, something familiar. The discussion overwhelms an already-shaken Dalinar and he excuses himself. Troubled by the topic, Dalinar escapes to the storm shelters, hopeful that the familiar company of soldiers will calm him. While meeting with a group of veterans, he asks an elderly one about the civil war. The man tells him it was a nightmare, marked by men shouting to keep fighting even when it was no longer necessary, to keep up the momentum. The soldiers recalled seeing a haze that day. Hearing the description of their bloodlust, Dalinar feels it stir -- the Thrill awakening deep inside. He realizes he never learned to overcome it; rather, it had left him to come to Vedenar. Frantically trying to distract himself from the growing Thrill and the haunting events of Rathalas, Dalinar climbs the city wall to inspect the city fortifications. The Thrill continues to call to him, and a voice in his head urges him to give in. He then heads to the Oathgate, desperate to return to Urithiru so he can rest. A group of scribes, Kholin guards, and Navani are there. Curates from the Holy Enclave in Valath are also there, and their leader declares Dalinar a heretic due to his assertion that the Almighty is not God and excommunicates him. Knowing that he will kill the ardent if he stays, Dalinar dashes to the Oathgate control building before remembering he has no Shardblade to use as a key. Ignoring the Stormfather's warnings, he uses his bondsmith capabilities to produce something bright and white that he rams into the keyhole. The Stormfather groans in pain and pulls back. Dalinar is transported to Urithiru. He hears Evi's voice beckoning him to accept that this is who he is. He pulls the Way of Kings off his bookshelf, thinking about how it once saved him but how he can't even read it. It doesn't help. He ransacks Adolin's room and finally finds some wine, raising the bottle to his lips.

;Plot Summary
Adolin is in Captain Ico's cabin, refashioning clothes that the spren gave him. Ico enters and tells Adolin he can sense that he was a ruler in the Physical Realm, wondering why such a human would come to Shadesmar. Adolin doesn't answer and contemplates the thought of ruling, thinking that Dalinar will surely not abdicate now that Elhokar is dead but worries he may have to take the throne. Adolin talks with Azure on deck as another highstorm passes overhead, causing the Reachers to work more vigorously. Azure is impressed by how well Adolin improved his outfit, noting it's an unusual skill for a royal to have. Adolin asks her if she has known many royals, and after an enigmatic answer, she says she has known some, including a woman who abdicated her duty in favor of someone who could do it better. Such a concept is foreign to Adolin; you do your duty even if it's unwanted. Captain Ico bids Adolin to go with him into the brig to retrieve his "deadeye." Adolin sees another one in the brig, which Ico identifies as his father. Ico keeps him locked up so he won't go looking for his human corpse and fall overboard. Adolin is surprised since this implies that Ico's father is a Radiant spren. Ico cautions Adolin that his spren is not his friend, just a tool, and he shouldn't pretend otherwise. The ship pulls up to the dock as Adolin thanks Ico, asking once more if he'll take them to the portal between realms, but Ico declines since the region has gained a bad reputation due to vanishing ships. He advises them not to stray too far outside Celebrant and to visit the dock registrar which will help them find passage. The group agrees to split up: Kaladin, Adolin, and Syl will acquire rations and supplies, and Shallan, Pattern, and Azure will go to the dock registrar to try to find a ship.

;Plot Summary

'''Kaladin'''

Upon reaching Celebrant, a city with a stunning variety of spren, Kaladin, Adolin, and Syl head toward the market to resupply. Kaladin notices there are no spren "children." Syl explains to Kaladin how spren reproduce and says that it's rare, with some spren only partaking after hundreds of years. Kaladin is surprised that spren are so old, but Syl cautions that time doesn't affect spren in the same way, noting that without a bond, they don't change much. Kaladin spots an unusual painting at one of the stalls that depicts a kneeling figure with nine shadows.

'''Shallan'''

After consulting with the dock registrar, Shallan, Azure, and Pattern go from ship to ship to try to find a passage to the Peaks or Thaylen City. No one is sailing to Cultivation's Perpendicularity because voidspren, some of which are accompanied by Fused, are sailing warships there and demanding tribute from any who approach. As they approach Ico's ship, Azure sees a Fused there questioning Ico, and they hide in an alley.

'''Kaladin'''

The stall merchant, a Reacher, tells him that the painting was from the Court of Gods and that it is rare for one to escape being burned at the Court. It is a painting designed for those with divinity to see, and everyone who looks at it sees something different. Kaladin sees the nine unmade and knows that he must reach Dalinar. He hears a disturbance behind him and sees Adolin rushing up.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan is angry that the spren didn't tell her that Voidspren were in charge of the city. The ship catches fire.

'''Kaladin'''

Multiple spren appear to recognize Syl, who is disguised by both Shallan's lightweaving and clothing that Adolin bought at the market. Syl admits to Kaladin that she has been trying to hide her identity because there is a bounty on her capture/return to the honorspren capital, which she escaped when she came to the physical realm. Kaladin pulls her away from the crowd, then sees smoke up ahead.

'''Shallan'''

The Fused heads toward the registrar's office, and Shallan hurriedly puts disguises on all of them and tells them to look frightened. The Fused arrives and ignores them, instead yelling at the poor spren that he should have told him that there were humans there. He tells her to put out the fire and leaves. The spren realizes they are Radiants and rejoices, agreeing to help them.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin senses trouble and pulls the others with him into a tent. A Fused flies past. They head to the docks and run into Shallan's group, still disguised as the crew from the Reacher ship. With no other available options, Syl reveals herself to a white ship with gold accents -- the ship of honorspren that are sailing to Lasting Integrity, the honorspren capital. They recognize her and allow her and the others to board. Syl is restrained and cautions Kaladin against interfering. A Fused appears to see them boarding but flies away in the opposite direction.

He is surprised since the Stormfather, following Dalinar's encounter with Odium, had agreed the visions were now dangerous. Once again, the vision is not playing out like it did before. Instead of joining a young, morose Nohadon on the balcony overlooking the Desolation, he finds an aged Nohadon sitting in another room at a desk writing what he assumes is the Way of Kings, but the king cheerfully tells him that it is a shopping list and invites Dalinar to go shopping. A large shadow passes in front of the sun outside. Dalinar accompanies Nohadon to the market, contemplating how the old man reminds him of Taravangian. The enormous shadow appears again, followed by heavy footfalls that shake the ground, but Nohadon is busy haggling with a merchant and doesn't seem to notice. The shadow passes away while Nohadon tells Dalinar stories and philosophizes about the nature of principles. Frustrated and desperate for counsel, Dalinar laments that he and his allies can't seem to make any progress and that he's half-tempted to force them into it. The shadow and sound return, and Dalinar sees it's a giant stone creature with an angular face and red eye sockets (a [[Thunderclast]]). Nohadon touches the giant stone creature and it stills; he wonders aloud what it represents. Dalinar tells him it represents pain, tears, and burdens. He calls himself a hypocrite. Nohadon states that a hypocrite is "nothing more than a man who is in the process of changing." Dalinar realizes this is something that he himself once said. The city is suddenly overcome with more stone creatures as a seemingly-unaware Nohadon continues to philosophize, noting that although Dalinar has said the oaths, he doesn't understand the journey and what is required. The vision ends with Nohadon telling Dalinar that he has forgotten an essential part of the journey –- "the most important step a man can take."

Dalinar wakes up in Urithiru next to a mostly-empty bottle of wine. There was no storm, and he is uncertain what happened. Suddenly something blooms inside of him; not a new memory but a sudden crisp recollection –- the night of Gavilar's funeral.

;Plot Summary

Navani meets with the highprinces most closely aligned with Dalinar. They complain of Dalinar's absence and lack of leadership. Urithiru is suffering from basic infrastructure problems and lack of labor due to the revolt of the parshmen slaves. Navani feels resentment that Dalinar can hole up and drink while she handles matters, but she knows that all people have weak moments and someday he may return the favor. They discuss the city for hours. Navani advises them to keep the highking arrangement a secret for now. She goes to the library where Jasnah is heading the translation of the gemstone records. Renarin is there too, trying to figure out a pattern to how the gems were stored. Not much progress has been made on learning how to work the tower's fabrials. Navani reads some of the papers, one discussing Renarin's writing numbers on the wall to warn Dalinar. There is also word that The [[Stump]], probably a [[Truthwatcher]], will be visiting Azimir.

;Plot Summary
:''Six years ago''
Dalinar attends Gavilar's funeral in the royal catacombs of Kholinar. He is pained by the sight of his brother's body lying dead on a slab. [[Jevena]], a wizened ardent, preaches about how Gavilar was a good ruler who will fight on in the Tranquiline Halls. He asks Jevena what will happen after the Tranquiline Halls are retaken, hoping for peace and rest, but she instead comfortingly tells him that he will get another fight. The [[ketek]]s are read, and Dalinar realizes that one of them is Navani's. He spots her with her arm around Elhokar and trying to comfort Jasnah, who stalks off into the palace. A Soulcaster comes and turns Gavilar's body into stone, and Dalinar forces himself to watch. Elhokar swears vengeance on the Parshendi and asks the highprinces to join in his vow. Sadeas is the first to pledge. Dalinar heads back into the palace; Adolin catches up to him, concerned. Dalinar tells Adolin to pledge support for their house and runs into the palace. He fumbles with his keys, trying to enter his chambers to get some wine. He hears a feminine voice speaking, and is attracted by the words. He follows the sound and finds Jasnah reading from ''The Way of Kings''. Dalinar asks her to read to him, and she reads the entire text over the next several hours. When they are done, they cry a bit and embrace before going their separate ways. Dalinar talks to Adolin, apologizing for being a poor father to him and Renarin, then tells him that he will travel to the Shattered Plains by water. He plans to cause a delay, during which he can follow Evi's advice to seek the Old Magic.

Szeth flies southward with the Skybreakers and Nin for three days, stopping several times to recover hidden stockpiles that had been left alone for centuries. They reach Marat on their fourth day. Nin dismisses Ki and the others but keeps Szeth with him. They fly to another small town and enter the ruins of a courthouse. Nin admits to Szeth that he has failed in preventing the next Desolation. Ishar had warned him that Surgebinders of other orders might upset the balance and cause another Desolation. Nin looks at his hand; a simple but elegant honorblade appears. Nightblood tries to get Szeth to draw him, commenting that he thinks Nin might be evil, but Szeth refuses. Nin desires to be merciful, but feels it is too chaotic. The purpose of the law is to bring order and prevent sentimentality from interfering with the judgement process. He tells Szeth that he will have to swear his Third Ideal soon, but what he actually swears is up to him. Szeth points out that Nin's tendency to selectively hunt Surgebinders while ignoring other lawbreakers is biased. Nin does not deny it. He holds out his other hand, and a Shardblade appears. He tells Szeth that he is a Skybreaker of the Fifth Ideal, probably the only herald to join his own order's Radiants. He tells Szeth that he must know what happened on the day known as Aharietiam.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar wakes up and bathes, ready to come out of seclusion, at least for now. He meets Taravangian on the way to the latest meeting. He has been excluded, but Dalinar brings him along. As they walk, Dalinar asks if there has been any news, but Taravangian reports that there has been none. The Stormfather says he sensed Kaladin in the last highstorm, but he still can't find them. They arrive at the meeting, run by Aladar, and Dalinar asks to be updated. Fen doesn't allow his disappearance to be dismissed so easily, and Dalinar apologizes for hiding away. They discuss tactics for defending Jah Keved. The plan looks good, but Dalinar feels like they are missing something. He realizes that the enemy wants to gain another Oathgate, in a place hardest hit by the Everstorm: Thaylen City. They have Alethi troops already there (Sadeas' army helping in the clean-up), and they plan to send more. Fen's son points out that they need a navy to fight the stolen ships or they will just move on to another target. They scrape together more ships from Kharbranth and Azir. Dalinar leaves the meeting and seeks out Kadash. He apologizes to him for Rathalas and offers to turn the ardentia over to Taravangian. Kadash wants to remain part of the Alethi so he can help them through these trying times. He asks Dalinar to issue a statement asking his people to continue supporting and seeking out the ardents even though he has lost his faith. Dalinar asks the Stormfather who the leader (other than Odium) of the enemy is. He responds that he doesn't really know, but that he is watching someone in particular. Dalinar plans on bringing her into a vision in the next highstorm.

'''Taravangian'''

Taravangian returns to his rooms. Adrotagia reports that Graves is gone along with his shards. Malata enters and reports that Dalinar has had some visions that he hasn't shared. Taravangian worries that her spren won't want to work against the other orders, but Spark is quite willing and seems to be seeking revenge for the ashspren that died in the Recreance. Taravangian and Adrotagia proceed with their plot to undermine Dalinar's coalition.

;Plot Summary

'''Shallan'''

After spending a week locked up, Shallan and Kaladin are now on deck trying to figure out where they're headed. Kaladin is insistent that they get to Thaylen City somehow. Shallan briefly turns into Veil and suggests instigating a mutiny. Kaladin asks her to find a bead that would let them jump overboard and get to shore like before. She asks the captain if she can get some beads to practice with, and he agrees as long as she doesn't manifest anything. He expresses regret that the Radiants have returned.

Shallan spends the days on the ship studying various beads. Veil occasionally takes over, almost randomly. She sees the first mate returning Azure's Shardblade. Azure intends to trade information once they reach their destination; the honorspren may have information on her bounty: a sword that bleeds black smoke and the man who brought it here. Kaladin calls her a traitor, but she points out that she has no obligation toward them, and besides, her quest is also very important. Shallan retreats back to her bucket. Adolin comes over and hugs her as she talks about her struggles. He confesses to her that he killed Sadeas.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin has walked up to the forbidden deck and is looking through a spyglass. The captain comes and asks him to not upset his crew. Kaladin again demands the release of Syl. The captain explains that she is too young to have a bond and he could just kill him to break it. Kaladin asks him if that is honorable, and the captain doesn't answer, ashamed. But he still won't release Syl. Kaladin moves off and contemplates the ideals that he has sworn, wondering how difficult the fourth one will be. Lights begin to appear around him, causing quite a stir amongst the crew, who gasp and scurry away. Syl speaks in his mind -- he is close to finding the fourth ideal. The captain comes over, amazed at the windspren around Kaladin. They're almost always in the Physical Realm and he has never seen them before. Kaladin once again appeals to him; he is a Windrunner sworn to protect, and the Bondsmith who leads them is in danger. The captain is astonished that there is a Bondsmith at all and replies that he will consider helping them.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin sees Kaladin surrounded by glowing lines of light, the crew looking on in amazement. Shallan (apparently as Veil) also looks on in admiration. Adolin knows that Shallan is attracted to Kaladin and wonders how he can compete with such a glorious figure. The lookout lowers her spyglass and begins to call out. Fused have been spotted.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar awaits the next highstorm, minutes away. Navani is nervous for him -- this is his first visit to the visions since Odium appeared to him in one -- but Dalinar needs to know his enemy. The highstorm arrives and he enters the vision with Nohadon as a younger man. A parshendi woman is there, in the place of the king's counselor. The Stormfather warns that Odium is aware of what is going on and is coming. Dalinar asks him to resist so he can talk with Venli.

'''Venli'''

Venli wonders if Odium has brought her here, but it is the wrong storm. The Alethi warlord approaches her and introduces himself as Dalinar Kholin. He asks what the conditions for a truce would be. She demands Alethkar, but he balks, suggesting other options, like splitting the kingdom and allowing a parshendi highprince. The vision starts to break apart as Odium arrives. A gaping hole opens up with brilliant light streaming through. She scrambles on the parts of the vision that are still there, trying to escape. She looks back and sees Dalinar glowing as a Radiant, holding together the balcony where he stands. She is awestruck by the [[Neshua Kadal|Knights Radiant]] that can resist her gods and win. Dalinar knits together the palace, and she rushes downstairs. A fierce wind starts up, and she hangs on. Timbre arrives, struggling to reach her. As she's blown toward the hole she snatches Timbre out of the air and falls into the hole. She hits the ground of the cave in Marat, Timbre still in her hand.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar feels like he's being ripped apart. The agony subsides and Odium appears as an old man. He assures Dalinar that there will be peace after Dalinar, not he, destroys the world. The vision ends and Dalinar hears the Stormfather weeping like a child, completely overwhelmed by Odium's power.

Azure is staying behind and reveals that she is looking for Zahel. The captain urges them to leave, and they all jump in, holding hands. Shallan creates a space underneath the beads shaped like a room so the humans can breathe. They wait for a while, hoping the Fused pass them by and chase the ship. Shallan lets the pattern of beads go, and they struggle to shore. Syl is already there, hiding amongst the trees. She reports that the Fused have moved on. A highstorm passes above, and Syl's color returns. Kaladin lashes everyone together, and they fly toward Thaylen City.

Dalinar arrives in Thaylen City and gets a report from Amaram. They have cleared the rubble in front of the walls and shored them up. He is angry that his troops are doing manual labor instead of being involved in the war. Fen's son provides room and refreshments before the meeting. Renarin asks if there are any large gemstones in their reserve in the city, but doesn't say why.

Dalinar washes up and talks with the Stormfather. He reveals that Cultivation is still alive and in hiding, and that's why Odium didn't splinter him in the last vision, for fear of exposing himself to her. He mentions another god-spren -- a "third sibling" who is slumbering -- but refuses to say more. He heads to the meeting and runs into Navani and "Vargo" (Taravangian) on the way, acting strangely. They go to the meeting.

The meeting is going very well with everyone encouraged about the defenses. Renarin starts to look uncomfortable and excuses himself from the room. Dalinar feels something wrong. The Stormfather says a storm is coming. All the spanreeds in the room light up; there are reports of an early Everstorm arriving in Shinovar. They decide to break, but the Stormfather says there's more coming. He goes over to Navani and Jasnah, who have received a translation of the [[Eila Stele]] which tells of events before the first Desolation. It reveals that ''humans'' were the Voidbringers, arriving in Roshar and conquering the parshmen. This would eventually cause the Recreance. Taravangian has apparently received the same news and expresses concern that the Radiants' powers are too dangerous. Fen has received word about Elhokar swearing to Dalinar as highking, and Noura has learned that Dalinar is holding back information on his visions that included visits from Odium. The whole room erupts in arguments, and Dalinar realizes that he has been outflanked diplomatically. The coalition is falling apart.

They walk through the forest now in order to conserve Stormlight. Tarah's admonition pushes Kaladin along; he must get to Dalinar to help him.

She is dumped onto one of hundreds of ships waiting in harbor, where Rine is waiting for her. He informs her that she is to accompany them as they sail for an assault. Venli is surprised that they are leaving so soon, expressing reservations on needing to fight.

Rysn prepares for an audit of the [[Thaylen Gemstone Reserve]], where she now works. Her pet [[Larkin]], Chiri-Chiri, wants to feed off of her diamond mark, but Rysn needs it for light. A porter knocks, admitting Vstim, who has accepted an appointment as Queen Fen's minister of trade. Chiri-Chiri is suspicious of him, so he pulls out a ruby that she can feed on. She sucks in the Stormlight and nestles in the pot of Shin grass. Vstim has heard from her boss that she is unhappy. He offers her the captain's cord to ''[[Wandersail (1174 ship)|The Wandersail]]'', an expensive and majestic frigate. She hesitates at accepting such a grand gift, and he urges her to at least just consider it for now. He reveals that he is doing this audit personally. He has always wanted to visit the vault.

Rysn enters her combination to the first door, then they pass two more doors that are opened by guards, one of whom is unfamiliar to her. Rysn is taken through to an alcove that Fladm is waiting in, and she's transferred to a palanquin that Tlik and another guard carry her in, to her embarrassment. Chiri-Chiri follows her into the main vault. The vault is full of gemstones, but it is dark; they are traded on ledgers, backed by the confidence that the reserve is safe and intact. Rysn gives Vstim a key, and he unlocks Vault Thirteen, the queen's own vault. This closet-sized vault is full of light, much of it coming from a giant ruby, the [[King's Drop]]. Vstim covers it with a cloth to reduce the glare, and the audit begins. Suddenly, the unfamiliar guard stabs Tlik and grabs the ruby, wounding Vstim and locking him in vault 13. Other guards attack, but the thief is able to heal. As more guards arrive to the fight, Rysn grabs the King's Drop, ties it to her leg, and pulls herself down the corridor. Chiri-Chiri feeds from the ruby. Rysn reaches Fladm's corpse and yells for help, taking his crossbow. Chiri-Chiri harrasses the thief, feeding from his [[Voidlight]]. The traitor is revealed to be one of the [[Fused]] that can lightweave. Rysn shoots him in the chin right as he looms over her. His Voidlight gone, he drops to the floor and is still.

;Plot Summary
:''Five and a half years ago''
Dalinar awakes in the cabin of a stormwagon, not remembering what happened earlier due to his heavy drinking. Felt informs him that the caravan they were traveling with will be departing early, despite the rain. Dalinar tells Felt to pay the caravan master extra to buy his silence. The men continue traveling on their own. Along the way, Felt gives some advice for visiting the Nightwatcher, telling him to go in alone after sunset and warning him that the curse could be bad. They arrive at the Valley in an otherwise barren landscape, but here, plant life almost frantically grows. Felt tells Dalinar that there are paths through the thick foliage if he looks hard enough. After the sun sets, Dalinar decides to go in a day early and pushes his way into the forest. As he trudges forward, Dalinar begins to doubt himself, but then hears noises, the sound of people pleading for their lives and weeping. Dalinar summons his Shardblade, Oathbringer, and starts slashing at the undergrowth, trying to clear a path for himself. Suddenly, he sees himself smiling and killing parshmen in the Unclaimed Hills, then strangling Elhokar and taking the throne for himself, followed by conquering other kingdoms and building an empire over half the continent. Then he sees a thousand villages being burned like the Rift for resisting. Dalinar realizes that this could be his future. Just then, the Nightwatcher shows up, asking him what he wants for his boon. Dalinar asks for forgiveness, but the Nightwatcher does not understand the concept very well and becomes agitated, offering things like material possessions, including [[Nightblood]], and enhanced skills. She is interrupted by a [[Cultivation|strange woman]] who appears in the grove, who she addresses as "Mother." She speaks with Dalinar, and he realizes that she is Cultivation. Cultivation offers him a "pruning" to let him grow by blocking his memories of Evi. Dalinar accepts the offer and has those memories removed. The next morning, he crawls out of the woods, feeling very tired. Dalinar realizes that he is now unable to remember anything about his wife, including her name, other than the fact that he had a wife who was assassinated. He orders his men to prepare to travel to the Shattered Plains for the war and asks for the sailors to get a copy of ''The Way of Kings'' while in port.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar watches the Everstorm approach and settle over the city. The enemy ships sail in with the storm and arrive uncontested, his armada having fled the storm. Amaram's troops flood into the space between the walls and the water while reinforcements are called from Urithiru. Dalinar wonders why Cultivation allowed his memories to return. What is the step he must now take? He picks up his copy of Way of Kings and heads out into the city.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan is flanked by Adolin and Kaladin as she looks upon the oathgate platform, guarded by Fused and a dark mass of red light. Adolin thinks that it's a trap, that Kaladin's vision was a deception. Kaladin insists that they try to break through anyway, as all the oathgates are probably guarded. Shallan has little hope that she can make the oathgate work even if they manage to get there.

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah watches troops head to the oathgate, but she knows Thaylen City is lost. There is something else she must do first. She finds Renarin in a temple, kneeling alone. With him is a spren, its form different than the spren of a Truthwatcher. She summons her Shardblade.

'''Venli'''

Venli goes on shore. One of the Fused hands her a sword in case she has to defend herself, for she is only here as an interpreter. One the groups of listeners is reluctant to attack their home; they are happy to be free, but they are not trained to be warriors. The Fused rejects their pleas to not fight. They visit other groups with similar reservations, but the Fused remains firm and encourages them to obey to gain forms of power. The listener troops form up awkwardly. Venli sees spirits of Fused arrive along with a huge mass of red smoke. Then she feels blistering heat and knows that Odium is coming. He manifests as a parshman with gold and white marbled skin.

'''Teft'''

Teft runs through the corridors trying to find some place to hide, somewhere to hide forever. His spren appears to him again, but he pushes past her and continues to run. He hears shouting and walks onto a balcony. Singers flood through the oathgate from Kholinar.

'''Navani'''

Navani rushes to Fen on the city wall. She assures Fen that they can still defend the city with Amaram's troops. The ground starts shaking and a stone monster rises from the ground.

'''Venli'''

Venli watches as the souls of the thunderclasts meld into the ground. She sees, in the Cognitive Realm, another force offshore. The Fused bow to Odium, so Venli quickly follows suit. [[Turash]], the sane Fused that Venli had been interpreting for, expresses doubt to Odium about their army, but Odium replies that they have only come to watch. The red power enters the Physical Realm and she feels the Thrill.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin watches the red mass vanish and many of the other Fused as well. Only six remain to guard the oathgate.

'''Venli'''

Venli watches as the red power enters Amaram's army. Their eyes start glowing red. Odium tells them to exact revenge on Dalinar for the death of Sadeas. Bonded with the Thrill, they turn and attack the city.

;Plot Summary

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin approaches the Fused guarding the gate, reflecting on his life. He thinks back on how his life is still painful in certain areas, but now also has purpose. The Fused spot him and seem confused at facing a single man. Kaladin draws in stormlight and Lashes himself straight up. Four of the Fused chase after him.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar feels the ground shaking, realizing that there is probably a second thunderclast now. He sees civilians running and panicking, heading towards the Oathgate. Dalinar continues running toward the wall, holding ''The Way of Kings'' close. Suddenly, he feels the Thrill, but he resists the temptation to embrace it. He is hit by a falling boulder from the thunderclast destroying a building nearby. Dalinar uses stormlight to heal himself. The thunderclast is furiously attacking the Thaylen Gemstone Reserve. He is confused by this odd behavior and asks the Stormfather about it, but he doesn't know why either. Two Fused, led by a yellow spren, glide (with what appears to be the Surge of Abrasion) over to a palanquin and steal something from the occupant. Dalinar tries to give chase, but is unable to catch up to the Fused. He then runs over to help Rysn and Vstim and Rysn tells him that the stolen object was a ruby, the King's Drop. Dalinar is baffled at why they'd want a gemstone. He prepares to ask for more details when he notices that the figures with glowing red eyes on the battlefield are not parshmen, but Sadeas troops.

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah creeps into the temple, Shardblade in hand. Renarin's spren spots her and panics, disappearing. She and Ivory realize that Glys is corrupted yet somehow bonded to a human. Jasnah overhears Renarin whispering about seeing something bad happen to Dalinar.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan creates the illusions of a small squad of various people she has sketched. Adolin, Pattern, Syl, and Adolin's deadeye hide among them. They run onto the bridge and distract the remaining two Fused. Meanwhile, Shallan makes her way to the Oathgate platform by using the beads and some Stormlight to cross under the platform bridge. She approaches the two Oathgate spren and catches their attention.

'''Venli'''

Venli sees that there is now only one remaining figure, a black figure of swirling smoke the size of a normal person, as many of the ancient singers have found bodies at this point. One of the thunderclasts places down two Fused, who slide along on the rock, carrying a gemstone. Odium tells Venli that the theft of the ruby was a last-minute precaution that he added, and that he plans to not only win the city, but his freedom. He orders her to approach the broken section in the wall to translate for him. Venli starts walking, accompanied by the dark spirit.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin continues flying, followed by four of the six Fused. He notices that his Lashings are more powerful, but the Fused are more graceful fliers. A malen Fused jabs his lance at Kaladin, and he Lashes himself aside just in time. Kaladin realizes that his harpoon is much shorter than the Fused's lance. He puts multiple downward Lashings on his harpoon and drops the weapon, causing it to smack into the Fused. The startled creature drops his own lance, and Kaladin dives downward in a dangerous maneuver, almost blacking out. He snatches the falling lance as it drops by him. The disarmed Fused goes after the dropped harpoon. He flies off toward the obsidian mountains.

'''Yanagawn'''

Yanagawn paces around in the cabin of his ship, thinking about how he is getting used to being emperor, but that he still has his limitations. He tries to exert his power as emperor to return and fight, but his advisors hold a check on his power. Vono, the guardsman in charge of watching Lift, enters, and reports that she knocked him out and escaped. Another messenger reports that the Alethi troops have turned against the city. Noura orders them to pull away from any ships with Alethi troops as Yanagawn sits down, troubled at the news.

'''Shallan'''

The two Oathgate spren tell Shallan that she is not allowed to use the portal. She protests that she has Stormlight, but they tell her that they were ordered by Honor to not allow travel to and from Shadesmar. Meanwhile, Adolin, Pattern, and Syl are blending in with the illusions by acting like them and randomly slashing around, confusing the Fused trying to spot them. Shallan pleads for access, but the spren only apologize and refuse to do that which is forbidden.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth and Nin hover above the battlefield, watching. Szeth points out the Sadeas troops changing sides, and Nin replies that they have "seen the truth," that the parshmen are the rightful owners of Roshar. Szeth is uncomfortable with this, but is forced to agree that his logic is sound. The sword interrupts Szeth's contemplation, urging him to fight the parshmen. Szeth replies that he has no choice, and Nightblood brings up the time he spent following his oathstone. Szeth tries to rebut the sword's argument, saying that he had no choice in what he did, but then realizes that his oathstone was just a rock all along, and that he actually did have a choice.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin flies about, looping around a mountain and enjoying the flying as the Fused continue their pursuit. He turns back towards the Oathgate to check on Shallan, who waves her hands to signal that she needs more time. He attacks the Fused with the harpoon and steals his weapon. The disarmed parshman draws his sword and joins his comrades, saying something Kaladin is unable to comprehend. He tells the Fused that if it was a challenge, then he gladly accepts. Just then, Kaladin's Stormlight runs out.

'''Navani'''

Navani unwedges the rock and pushes it out of the way, opening a path. Fen points out that the stairway survived. Navani hesitates before heading down, looking at the battlefield. She sees the two thunderclasts and the churning red mist, one of the Unmade. Soldiers with glowing red eyes enter the city through the gap in the wall. She then sees Amaram with Odium's troops and realizes that he has changed sides. Finally, Navani notices Dalinar making his way through the hole in the city wall, unarmed and carrying a book, heading towards the Voidbringer forces outside.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar watches as Amaram's army enters the city. Suddenly Lift is there and asks what he wants her to do. He charges her with the task of stealing the ruby back. He warns her that the Fused who took it has similar powers to hers. She leaves, and Odium arrives with Venli and some other Fused.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin and Pattern continue their charade, blending in with the illusions. One of the Fused cuts her hand with a knife and sprays the blood toward them. The blood passes through the illusions but hits Adolin. Now they know who is real, and the Fused attack Adolin, disarming him of his harpoon. He draws his only weapon left, his knife, and tries to apply his training with Zahel -- knife vs. spear. He successfully dodges the attack, but the Fused can fly, negating his skill. He runs Adolin through with his lance. He draws a sword to finish him off, but Adolin's deadeye savagely attacks the Fused. Adolin struggles over toward Shallan, bleeding heavily.

'''Shallan'''

The spren refuse to open the Oathgate. Shallan has tried everything, including a disguise. She is attacked by a Fused and barely dodges. When it swoops back around for another try, she somehow manifests a wall from the Physical Realm, and the Fused slams into it. Adolin arrives, bleeding from his gut and his back. They jump into the beads to get to Kaladin.

'''Lift'''

Lift slides through the army, easily dodging them as they try to grab her. She breaks free of them and slides on her knees, trailing after the Fused that appears to be holding something. She notices Lift and stops, saying something Lift can't understand, but it sounds like she is amused. She takes off with more grace than Lift has, and she follows.

'''Szeth'''

Nin and Szeth watch the battle. The Skybreakers will swear to the Dawnsingers since Roshar is their home. Szeth hesitates to do the same, not trusting his judgment. He asks if he can follow a person instead of the law when he swears the Third Ideal. Nin cautions that men have caused him pain before when he followed them. Szeth looks at Dalinar and wonders if he was just following the wrong ones.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin crashes into the beads and struggles to swim. Despite his efforts, he is pulled under. Syl grabs him and pulls him up the bank. Adolin and Shallan are there too, and Kaladin tries to treat Adolin's wounds. He is gravely injured and asks for a knife to finish himself off. They are out of Stormlight. Syl encourages Kaladin to say the Words.

'''Dalinar'''

Odium takes Dalinar by the shoulder. Dalinar senses his immense power and knows it is hopeless to fight him. He remembers Honor's advice and asks for a test of champions.

'''Lift'''

Lift continues to follow her quarry, weaving through the soldiers waiting impatiently to enter the city. She tries standing up so she can gain on her, but she is thrown to the ground by the stomping of a thunderclast. The monster slams a fist down again, killing three soldiers and crushing Lift. She manages to heal and draw Wyndle as a rod as the thunderclast prepares to attack again. A spear of light slices the creature in two and it evaporates. Szeth is there, holding Nightblood, drawn. He asks her what his master the Blackthorn has assigned her to do, and he joins her.

'''Navani'''

Navani runs toward Dalinar, unlatching her fabrial and using it as light in the dark stairwell. She is slammed against the wall by soldiers with red eyes. They hold Fen and Kmakl as well, anticipating a generous reward from Amaram.

'''Shalash'''

Ash searches through the Alethi camp, stopping to deface an image of herself on a brazier. She marvels that Odium can bond his spren to humans and has created his own storm. She finds Taln in a tent.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin looks at the stained glass in the temple and sees various futures. He sees Jasnah striking him down. To his horror, he sees Dalinar become the champion of Odium.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar is certain now, he wants a contest of champions. Odium makes sure that this is his true desire, and Dalinar confirms it. Dalinar guesses that Amaram will be his opponent, but in fact ''he'' is the chosen champion of Odium. The Thrill rushes into him.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Odium fills Dalinar's mind with vivid memories of all the horrific things he has done. Odium tells Dalinar to blame him and to give his guilt and pain to him.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth mows down Amaram's troops with Nightblood unsheathed. He spots the Fused with the gemstone and chases her, destroying more soldiers on the way. The Fused dodges Szeth's strike and whips around, grabbing the sheath off of his back. He is unable to get close enough to lash her. Black veins begin to grow on his arm.

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah creeps up on Renarin as he looks this way and that, looking at the visions. Ivory warns Jasnah that he is using Odium's power to see things yet to come.

'''Ash'''

Ash kneels before Taln and begs him to recognize her. He ignores her and merely repeats the same speech over and over, preparing primitives for a Desolation.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin kneels down, surrounded by the Fused. He knows his only chance is to say the next set of Words. He stutters; windspren start to appear.

'''Lift'''

Lift and Wyndle are off to the side, well away from Szeth and his terrifying sword. They see him drop to his knees, and she rushes over. She tells him to drop the sword, but he is unable to.

'''Navani'''

Navani's captors decide to kill Kmakl, as he is of no use to them. Navani flips open her fabrial and presses it against the soldiers. They writhe in pain and pass out. They head back up the stairs to the top of the wall. Navani sees Dalinar facing a vast, angry force.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar sees himself at Rathalas with glowing red eyes. He clutches his book closer to his chest, and Odium destroys it, mocking the author.

'''Teft'''

Teft continues to hide while he listens to his Bridge Four mates dying.

'''Kaladin'''

He tries to finish saying the Words. He thinks of Tien.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar seems to literally relive the moment he sets Rathalas afire, hearing Evi's screams and crying. Odium banishes the Stormfather, leaving Dalinar utterly alone. Odium pleads with Dalinar to give him his pain. Dalinar realizes he has been a fraud.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth tries to make his way to Dalinar, but he collapses, overcome by his sword. Lift places her hands on his head and heals him as much as she can, then realizes that she is trapped too. Black veins creep up her arms.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin sees the fall of Dalinar. He will be Odium's champion.

'''Venli'''

Odium thinks he has accomplished his design and tells Turash that Dalinar is their new leader. Amaram comes up and delivers a silvery sheath as ordered. Another Fused gives Amaram Yelig-nar's smokestone; Odium tells him to swallow it if he wants his promised power.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin cannot say the next Words and collapses, weeping. Syl embraces him.

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah raises her Shardblade to strike, and Renarin looks at her, nodding. She dismisses her blade and embraces her cousin. Ivory agrees with Jasnah's decision even though it doesn't make sense to him. Renarin realizes that since the vision about Jasnah didn't come true, other visions are not predestined either, like his vision about Dalinar.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar rejects Odium's offer to take his pain. He needs to take the most important step a man can take: the ''next one''.

;Plot Summary

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar refuses to let Odium have the responsibility for his atrocities. Amaram and the Fused nearby shy back as gloryspren circle Dalinar. He feels the presence of the Stormfather again and says the next oath, taking responsibility for his crimes but promising to always do better.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin and Jasnah race after the light and gloryspren gathering at the base of the wall.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar hears "unite them!" in his mind as thousands of gloryspren stream around him.

'''Kaladin'''

Syl senses what is happening and tells Kaladin that maybe this time someone can rescue him for a change.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar reaches his left hand into the Cognitive Realm and his right into the Spiritual Realm as his enemies stumble backward -- all but Venli, who asks what he is in a whisper. He hears Evi's voice; she forgives him. The pain of his role in her death begins to fade. Dalinar turns his head to Venli and states "I am unity." He slams his hand together, combining the three Realms.

'''Kaladin'''

Light explodes in Shadesmar and the attacking Fused are driven away. A glowing pillar appears, which Syl identifies as Honor's perpendicularity.

'''Ash'''

Taln asks Ash how long it has been since the last Desolation. He's overjoyed to hear that it's been four thousand years. Humans have a chance this time because they were able to advance. He goes to meet Dalinar, feeling that he is waiting for them though he does not know who Dalinar is, pulling Ash along.

'''Teft'''

Teft finally says the next oath of the Windrunners, of a slightly different form than Kaladin's. He swears to protect those he hates, even if the one he hates the most is himself.

'''Renarin'''

Jasnah and Renarin reach the possessed troops. She uses soulcasting and her Shardblade to sweep them away. Renarin feels a surge of Stormlight and sees the column of light, stretching into the clouds.

'''Navani'''

Navani leans over the top of the city, laughing with joy as gloryspren stream around her as they are flying towards Dalinar. All of the gemstones scattered on the ground light up, taking in the Stormlight from Dalinar.

'''Dalinar'''

Odium orders his minions to attack Dalinar. Amaram steps up, and Dalinar tries to persuade him to follow his lead. But Amaram cannot forgive himself, and he attacks with Oathbringer. Kaladin parries with a Shardspear and emerges from the column. Shallan and Adolin follow.

'''Lift'''

Lift fights against the sword, black veins creeping up her arms. Suddenly, the gemstones on the ground light up, and Szeth drinks up the Stormlight, sating the sword. Lift scolds Nightblood for almost eating them, and Nightblood drowsily replies that it was really hungry. They head toward the column of light.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar realizes that Elhokar has not emerged from the column with the others, and knows that this means Elhokar has been killed. The power fades, the gloryspren disperse, and Dalinar is left feeling exhausted. The Stormfather is unsure what has happened. Dalinar says they have a [[Connection]] different from what was possible when Honor was alive. The Knights Radiant gather around Dalinar. The Stormfather recognizes Taln and Ash as they arrive. Kaladin asks for orders. They are still impossibly outnumbered by Amaram's troops, who are recovering their composure and are still consumed with the Thrill. He orders Renarin to secure the Oathgate, Shallan to conjure up an army, Jasnah to defend the hole in the wall, and Kaladin to engage Amaram. He reiterates his previous order to Lift and Szeth. He walks toward the water for his own task.

;Plot Summary

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin flies into the sky, watching Dalinar walk toward the red mist. Syl reassures Kaladin that he doesn't need more reasons to criticize himself. Kaladin, still holding the Syl-spear lashes himself to the ground in front of Amaram, who is choking and gasping, seemingly having just swallowed something.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin feels the part of his soft new flesh that was once his wound. He reflects on the feeling of being fragile, and being drawn through the Perpendicularity created by Dalinar. Shallan checks on Adolin's wound, and he tells her to go and save the city and to "be radiant." Shallan leaves Adolin, draws Pattern as a Shardblade and Lightweaves an army. Without a specific task, Adolin goes into the city to find Jasnah standing amidst a previous battlefield. Adolin summons his Shardblade, and after it doesn't scream in his hands, apologizes and thanks it, then rushes to join a nearby battle. 

'''Szeth'''

Szeth and Lift come up with a plan to get the Ruby back, while Nightblood reflects on both Lift's morality and compares Szeth to its former masters, including Vasher. 

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin and a red-eyed Amaram meet each other, with Amaram drawing both Oathbringer and his second Shardblade (Helaran's blade that Kaladin had won and Amaram had stolen). Amaram's Shardplate begins pulsing red and leaking black smoke, and he suddenly attacks.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar steps up to confront the Thrill, watching visions of battles from the past, speaks to it briefly and then enters it.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan pulls forth her army of drawings (including ones she had lost, such as Yalb), still holding Pattern as a Shardblade. She Lightweaves her brothers, her mother and father, and the illusions start to falter until she feels someone grab her left hand; Veil. She is startled, and then feels someone take her other hand; Radiant in her glowing Shardplate. Shallan commands her illusions to attack. 

'''Adolin'''

Adolin leads a small group of troops through the city after some enemy troops who are converging on Jasnah's position. He is interrupted by several red-eyed soldiers falling through the air, seemingly thrown. He peeks around the corner to see Jasnah standing alone, surrounded by a fading, glowing silhouette of smoke geometric shapes that had been outlining her. With Jasnah not needing help, Adolin and his group rush to the aid of Thaylen soldiers fighting a larger group of enemies. Adolin attacks the rear of the enemy formation with his Shardblade, killing all of them. A voice from the crowd, Kdralk the son of Queen Fen from Thaylenah, asks for Adolin's help as his mother and father are trapped behind the wall.

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah dismisses Ivory as a Shardblade, and the two have a conversation of the three realms. Jasnah can now see gloryspren in the way they appear in the cognitive realm, which she notes as one of the less unnerving things they'd seen that day. She feels an immense amount of Stormlight inside of herself, and when soldiers break through Shallan's army of illusions, she finds it extremely simple to Soulcast them to smoke, something that would have taken an extreme amount of effort and concentration in the past. Ivory remarks that the three realms were slowly separating back to normal, and Jasnah states that they should take advantage of them while they can. She approaches a giant hole in the wall, and raises her hands.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth and Lift approach the Parshmen army. Lift slips into the Parshmen ship, the Parshmen not aggressive. Szeth notes Nin in the sky above the battle. A Fused streaks out of the ship, carrying the large ruby, escaping Lift. Szeth chases the Fused through the battlefield of illusions, and eventually catches up to and crashes into them. Both eventually crash into the ground, where Szeth scoops up the ruby, and draws the attention of three more Fused. 

'''Adolin'''

Adolin and his men join Navani beyond the wall, where Adolin informs Navani of Elhokar's death. Navani and Adolin join Queen Fen on the wall. As Adolin begins to formulate a defense, Jasnah interrupts by mending the walls around them and repairs the giant hole. 

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah hears a murmur in the debris and Soulcasts the rubble to reveal the corpse of a Thaylen Shardbearer and his blade. Adolin orders Kdralk to take soldiers, retrieve the Shardblade and to rescue troops throughout the city. Adolin summons his blade, and goes to help take down the Thunderclast. 

'''Kaladin'''

Amaram and Kaladin fight, as Amaram slowly continues to transform. Kaladin breaks off his attack to help defend Dalinar, and barely avoids arrows shot by Amaram from a Shardbow. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar confronts the Thrill, reliving battles from his life with each step. He ponders the intent of the Thrill. 

'''Jasnah'''

Jasnah lingers between realms, and Soulcasts air into steps to the top of the wall to meet Navani and Queen Fen. She notices that Shallan is nearly out of Stormlight from creating her illusory army, and tells Navani that they need to rally a defense. Jasnah defends the group from two Fused nonchalantly, setting one on fire and bisecting the other. Jasnah commands that they must hold the wall by conventional means until Urithiru sends reinforcements. 

'''Szeth'''

Szeth continues his battle with the Fused, attempting to get to Dalinar. Szeth throws the Ruby, which the Fused chase, and uses the distraction to get back to Lift. 

'''Shallan'''

Shallan continues to project her illusions to feed the enemies Thrill. She's suddenly interrupted by Lift. 

'''Kaladin'''

Amaram and Kaladin continue their duel, Amaram baiting him while Kaladin searches for an opening to attack. Kaladin scores a hit on Amaram's plate, cracking it. As Amaram gains his footing, his boot explodes, showing a foot covered in carapace. Throughout the battle, Amaram continues to transform, his plate erupting and exploding off of his body as Kaladin is continually distracted by the Fused around Dalinar. Amaram is joined in battle by another Fused in full carapace armor. 

'''Adolin'''

Adolin joins the fight between the Thunderclast and the Thaylen army, using his Shardblade. As he ponders the purpose of the Shardblade against the Thunderclast, he senses a "tickle" in his mind and hears one word, Mayalaran (the name of his Shardblade). Adolin manages to injure the Thunderclast multiple times, managing to hack one of the feet free. As Adolin is fighting the Thunderclast, he's grabbed by a hand in Shardplate and ripped into a nearby shop. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar reflects on the Thrill and the points in his life that it had affected him, but he embraces what he was, rejects the Thrill, and thanks it for the strength it had lent him. 

'''Venli'''

Venli and Timbre attempt to escape the battlefield after Odium has withdrawn. Venli begins to speak the First Ideal, but is interrupted by a Fused who rifles through her satchel looking for Timbre, who is not there. She manages to persuade the Fused, and makes her way onto one of the ships where she becomes aware that Timbre is in her gemheart, keeping the voidspren captive. She barges into the cabin of the ship after nabbing a sphere from a parshman, closes the door and speaks the final words of the First Ideal.

'''Adolin'''

Adolin is greeted by the Thaylen Shardbearer, Hrdalm. Hrdalm is overtaken by two Fused, and Adolin manages to throw his Shardblade Maya at one, finishing it off while Hrdalm bats the other away. Adolin manages to slice off a finger of the Thunderclast, but is knocked back by a slap, his Shardblade dropping and disappearing. Adolin frantically moves to escape the Thunderclast, counting out heartbeats for his Shardblade. As he reaches the seventh count, he consciously calls to Maya, and she appears in his hand three seconds early. After Adolin is knocked down by the Thunderclast, Renarin appears carrying his Shardblade. Adolin notices the Thunderclast steps back, seemingly afraid of Renarin. Renarin uses Stormlight to heal Adolin, while commanding Adolin to retreat before charging the Thunderclast. Renarin is crushed by the Thunderclast, but heals and slices off the beast's hand. Adolin reluctantly lends Maya to Hrdalm, and then goes to help hold the streets.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth chases down a Fused carrying the Ruby. The Fused uses the power of Abrasion, and Szeth feigns ignorance of it until he's in a position to lash the Fused into the sky and catches the Ruby in his pouch. Szeth manages to trick the Fused into thinking they stole the pouch with the Ruby in it, but instead the Ruby was handed to Lift, who hid in an illusion of a rock. Together, Lift and Szeth go to Dalinar, but Szeth entrusts the Ruby to Lift as he can't bring himself to approach the red mist. Lift enters the red mist alone. 

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin continues fighting a transforming Amaram. Syl changes into a shield and helps Kaladin disarm one of Amaram's Shardblades, although Kaladin isn't able to use this to his advantage as he was fighting both Amaram and a large Fused. Kaladin allows the Fused to impale him, then lashes the Fused up into the sky through the mist. Kaladin and Amaram continue their battle amidst the Everstorm, Amaram explaining his motives. Kaladin goads Amaram, pressing the High Prince to attack. Enraged, Amaram jumped up to Kaladin and hung in the air, right where Kaladin had wanted him. Fighting in the sky, Kaladin manages to crack the gemstone in Amaram's chest, and the Amaram falls to the ground defeated. As Amaram collapses, eight Fused (including the one Kaladin sent flying) return to fight Kaladin in order to remove him from helping Dalinar.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin and Hrdalm have finished breaking off both of the Thunderclasts legs, as well as one of its arms. Glys tells Renarin how to defeat Thunderclast, drawing in a large amount of Stormlight. Hrdalm is sent to help the battle while Renarin goes for the Oathgate.

'''Shallan'''

Stormlight running out and body overtaxed, Shallan's illusions falter and fail. The Fused move through the dying illusions toward Shallan, Veil and Radiant, but Jasnah steps between them and the approaching Fused. Jasnah Soulcasts a barrier of flames. Jasnah reaches for Shallan, but instead Shallan puffs away into smoke, revealing that the "real" Shallan was in the form of Radiant. Shallan asks Jasnah if she's real, which she confirms. Jasnah and Shallan go to leave the battle, and Shallan is mesmerized with how easily Jasnah Soulcasts air into a prison of stone around the Fused. 

'''Renarin'''

Renarin makes his way to the Oathgate, where he observes a dozen Fused hovering above it. Renarin greets survivors (including Brightness Teshav) who inform him about Urithiru. Renarin replenishes his Stormlight and goes to open the portal, shocked that no one told him to stop. Renarin and Glys as a Shardblade confront Fused at the gate, when he is suddenly struck with one of his fits, showing him a vision, leaving him smiling. Just then, the Oathgate erupts with light, and a Kholin Alethi division marches forth, led by a bearded man holding a large, silver Shardspear, bathed in white: Teft. 

'''Shallan'''

Pattern, Veil and Radiant comfort an exhausted Shallan while Navani, Jasnah and the Generals discuss the defense of the city. In the distance, the Parshmen army carry large ladders from their ships.

'''Renarin'''

Renarin, Lopen, Teft and Bridge Four set up a defense of the Oathgate. 

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar continues grappling with the Thrill, when he feels Lift grabbing his hand from behind, and hands him the Ruby. Holding the Gemstone above his head, Dalinar embraces the Thrill one last time. 

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin continues fighting and delaying the eight Fused. Kaladin manages to kill two of the Fused, but slowly runs out of Stormlight and is incapacitated. Something behind Kaladin makes the Fused retreat, as Kaladin watches the red mist thrash and finally disappears. Amaram stumbles to his feet, drawing a Shardblade and moving toward Kaladin. As he is about to strike Kaladin, two large arrows strike Amaram, one  in the head, the other breaking the gem in his chest, killing him. Kaladin looks up to see Rock, glowing brightly and holding Amaram's Shardbow. 

'''Shallan'''

Shallan and the others watch as the armies begin to rush the city. Suddenly, the red light flashes from the Parshmen and Amaram's troops. The Fused begin to retreat, and the defenders cheer. 

'''Kaladin'''

Lopen offers Kaladin Stormlight infused spheres, healing his wounds. Lopen points out a weeping Dalinar, who is holding the large Ruby that is now the prison to the Unmade [[Nergaoul]], flanked by Lift. Dalinar informs Kaladin that "it's over."

;Plot Summary
'''Moash'''

Moash is breaking apart the rubble of the Kholinar palace, near where he killed Elhokar, when Leshwi flies over to him and informs him that Hnanan needs to speak with him. Moash walks through the Kholinar palace until he reaches the balcony where Hnanan awaits. Hnanan compliments Moash on killing Elhokar, then asks him if he would do the same to a god, meaning Jezrien.

'''Navani'''

Navani runs across the broken battlefield of Thaylen City to reach Dalinar, who she embraces. Dalinar informs her of his returning memories and his confrontation with Odium, after which he kisses her. He then asks her to study the gemstone that held [[Nergaoul]] and to teach him to read.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan pushes off Jasnah and Navani's attempts to get her a palanquin as she, Radiant, and Veil struggle for complete control of Shallan. Adolin approaches her, they embrace, and she gives in to him getting her a palanquin. Kaladin, Rock, and Lopen touch down near where Shallan stands, and Veil takes over, mooning over Kaladin. Shallan finally suppresses Radiant and Veil, putting them in the back of her mind, finally accepting her decision to marry Adolin.

'''Venli'''

Venli stands on the deck of a ship full of retreating Parshendi forces as Timbre pulses to her how many of his people died in the combat. She walks over to two parshmen, struggling with their identities post-Everstorm, to tell them of the listeners.

'''Szeth'''

Szeth talks with Nightblood about the battle, then is approached by Nin. Nin tells him of the Heralds' suffering on Braize, then accepts Szeth's Third and Fourth Ideals of the Skybreakers, with which Szeth gains access to the Surge of Division.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan is in better spirits after drinking some of Teshav's tea as she meets up with Adolin at the command post atop the city. Kaladin lands on a nearby rooftop, surveying the city, and Shallan glances at him. Adolin sees this and says he'll step back and let Kaladin have Shallan. Shallan goes on a long tangent about how she doesn't love Kaladin but that Adolin is the one for her, after which they passionately kiss, and Shallan commits to Adolin that none of her alternate personalities will take control and go after Kaladin.

'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin discusses with Syl the confliction he has over whether humanity, having lived on Roshar for thousands of years, or the Parshendi, the original inhabitants of Roshar, are in the right. He reaches the conclusion that he and Bridge Four will be different than the Knights Radiant who were a part of the Recreance by obeying their principles and oaths. He then thanks Teft for opening the Oathgate, and they both go together to console Rock.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar enters the temple of Talenelat'Elin to meet with his generals, he is approached by Taravangian, who reveals to Dalinar his intent to seize control of the coalition had the Alethi forces fallen. He also reveals Kharbranth's supposed possession of Battah'Elin and her warning of the imminent True Desolation.

'''Moash'''

Moash, with some Fused looking on, stabs a mad refugee in Kholinar, thus bringing a final death to Jezerezeh'Elin, King of the Heralds, the greatest human to ever live. 

'''Lopen'''

Lopen makes banter and jokes with Rua, teaching him a rude gesture in the process, then attends to some wounded soldiers, one of whom asks him how one becomes a Radiant. Lopen tells him the easy part is swearing the First Ideal: "Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before pancakes," but that the hard part is swearing the Second Ideal, which he swears, not expecting the Stormfather to accept it. He and Rua make the rude gesture at the Stormfather, as Lopen is angry the Stormfather hadn't accepted his oath in the heat of battle.

'''Ash'''

Ash drags Taln through Thaylen City, trying to reach the Oathgate and make it to Azir, where they will be more inconspicuous. Something inside Ash rips as Moash kills Jezrien, her father. Jasnah, nearby, notices and looks at a drawing she has of Ash and Taln from Hoid as Ash falls unconscious for the first time in thousands of years.

;Plot Summary
'''Kaladin'''

Kaladin flies overhead Alethkar, until he sees a very small fire giving off a bit of smoke next to a tarp painted with the symbol of Bridge Four. He lands, and two cloaked figures take off their hoods: Drehy and Skar. They reveal a couple of people they saved from the fighting in Kholinar, as well as Elhokar's son, Gavinor, heir to the Alethi throne. They also reveal that they have both sworn the Second Ideal of the Windrunners.

'''Taravangian'''

Taravangian finishes his day's puzzles, revealing he is stupid on this day, as his assistants, Mrall, Adrotagia, and Dukar, debate over the recent accuracy of the Diagram. A voice constantly asks Taravangian to open a window, which he does, and Odium enters the room. Odium sarcastically compliments the Diagram before showing Taravangian the absolute eternity within his plans. Taravangian attempts to bargain with Odium for the protection of everyone Taravangian rules, but Odium has seen through his plans to rule all Roshar to include all humanity under the protection. Taravangian instead strikes the best deal Odium will agree to: his service, in exchange for the protection of everyone born in Kharbranth and their spouses.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan, Dalinar, and many of Dalinar's generals as well as a few members of the coalition gather in a room in Urithiru. Shallan uses her Lightweaving to make a map of Roshar at Dalinar's request, changing the colors of various countries to depict which ones are members of the coalition, members of Azir's coalition, lands controlled by Odium, and lands that hadn't committed to either side, such as Shinovar and Tukar. The generals argue over what course of action to pursue, and Shallan raises the question of why the humans don't just retreat to Shinovar, the land they were given, to which Dalinar answers that Odium will overrun them even if they give the Parshendi what they deserve. Dalinar and Adolin then argue over who should become the next King of Alethkar, with Dalinar not wanting Gavinor, as he's too young, but Adolin doesn't want himself to be king, so he reveals to Dalinar his murder of Torol Sadeas and his breaking of the Codes of War.

'''Palona'''

Palona mingles and gossips in the grand conference room of Urithiru until the doors of the room slam open, revealing Jasnah Kholin wearing the crown of Alethkar on her head.

'''Moash'''

Moash continues to break apart rubble in Kholinar, when nine flying Fused approach him and offer him the Honorblade of Jezerezeh. The Fused rename him Vyre, He Who Quiets, and he Lashes himself to the sky.

'''Shallan'''

Shallan bickers with her alternate personalities again whilst awaiting her wedding to Adolin, when the door to her room opens to reveal her brothers, Balat, Wikim, and Jushu. Balat hands her a note from Mraize, who informs her that her debt for breaking one of their Soulcasters is repaid for frightening away Re-Shephir and that she will be needed to persuade Sja-anat to serve the Ghostbloods.

'''Dalinar'''

Dalinar enters his rooms, where he shows Navani some of his writing; she corrects some of his mistakes and he asks her a few questions, after which he begins writing Oathbringer by his own hand.

;Plot Summary
Wit stands in line behind a big man, speaking about how all great art is hated, since people have varying tastes, but that if something is not hated, then it cannot be great art. He starts insulting the man in front of him in Alethi, but then realizes that he can only speak Thaylen. Unwilling to repeat himself, Wit simply cuts the man in line, causing him to get punched in the jaw and lose a tooth. He thanks the man before walking away into an alley, letting himself take in the sights and sounds of the miserable people nearby. Wit then makes his way to a courtyard near the palace, where he talks to a woman named Kheni sitting by an empty cradle, continuing his speech on the values of art, asking how many people need to enjoy a work to make the hate worthwhile, before turning the conversation towards his appearance. He then picks up some rags from an old spren costume and ties them with a cord from his pocket, before making his way to a group of destroyed buildings. Wit goes to one that he detects life in, and a little girl sticks her head out. Wit speaks with her, and she tells him that she can't leave her mother (who is likely dead). He fashions a small doll from the scraps he is holding, and [[Awakening|Awakens]] it, having it walk down the street away from the building. This finally makes the girl come out, and she chases after the doll. He carries the girl to Kheni and her husband Cob, replying to his earlier question about the number of people needed to enjoy a work of art with that it only takes one person, then telling them that someone needs to take care of the girl, since he himself needs to leave the city. 

Wit leaves and heads towards the palace, acting like a crazy beggar. He passes Vatwha, a Fused sentry who he once danced with thousands of years before, but she doesn't notice him. He approaches a section of the fallen palace that the Fused and singers are working particularly hard at clearing the rubble in, wondering if anyone else found it strange that they focused so much on that section. Wit encounters a pair of common singers, and bows several times and tries to sell them trinkets from his pocket, continuing his act. The guards try to shove him away, but Wit pretends to panic and runs deeper into the worksite. He gets shouted at to leave, and continues faking fright, then purposely trips himself against a wall that is still standing. He addresses an unseen entity, telling them that they don't have a lot of options, that he believes he is in the city to find the entity, and promises to give them juicy truths if they come out. A moving pattern slips out of the cracks and onto his hand, which he hides in his rags. The singer guards catch up to him and toss him into the gardens. After they leave, Wit addresses the frightened-seeming Cryptic on his hand with "Life before death, little one".
