=== CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW ===
CHUNK_TYPE: Overview
CAMPAIGN: The Shattered Crown of Dominion
An ambitious sorcerer wields the ancient Orb of Dominion to subjugate nations through mind control and corrupted magic. The heroes must gather two sacred keystones to disable the orb and prevent total world domination.

=== CAMPAIGN BACKGROUND ===
CHUNK_TYPE: Background
CAMPAIGN: The Shattered Crown of Dominion
The Orb of Dominion was created millennia ago by a cabal of dragon lords to control lesser beings. When the dragons fell, the orb was shattered into four pieces and hidden across the realm. Malachar the Tyrant, a powerful sorcerer, has spent decades reassembling three of the four fragments, granting him immense power over minds and magic. The fourth fragment remains hidden, preventing him from achieving absolute dominion, but his current power already allows him to cast mass suggestion spells across entire cities. Kingdoms fall one by one as their leaders become his puppets, and his influence spreads like a plague across the land.

=== MAIN PLOT ===
CHUNK_TYPE: Plot
CAMPAIGN: The Shattered Crown of Dominion
The campaign begins as the players witness a major city fall under Malachar's influence, with citizens acting as mindless servants. They learn from allied NPCs about the Orb of Dominion and the two Keystones of Liberation that can disrupt its power: the Keystone of Will (hidden in the Crypts of Kelemvor) and the Keystone of Truth (guarded by celestial beings in the Floating Sanctum). The middle sessions involve gathering these keystones with the aid of resistance fighters and magical allies while evading Malachar's growing influence. Each keystone quest reveals more about the orb's history and Malachar's weaknesses. The final session culminates in infiltrating Malachar's fortress with a full team of NPC allies, using the keystones to disable the orb's protective enchantments, and facing the sorcerer in battle while he desperately tries to complete the fourth fragment and achieve ultimate power.

=== DM NOTES ===
CHUNK_TYPE: DM_Notes
CAMPAIGN: The Shattered Crown of Dominion
This condensed campaign relies heavily on NPC allies to provide support, guidance, and assistance in combat. Each session should feature multiple helpful NPCs who aid the party's progression and provide backup during challenging encounters. The allies should level up alongside the party or provide scaling support to match the increasing difficulty. Use the NPCs to provide exposition, tactical advice, and emotional moments when they're freed from or resist the orb's control. The compressed timeline means each session should feel significant - session 1 introduces the threat and allies, sessions 2-3 focus on keystone retrieval with heavy NPC support, session 4 is the assault with all allies participating, and session 5 is the final confrontation with the full team backing the heroes. Each location's elemental theme should influence combat encounters, environmental hazards, and the types of magical treasures found there. The treasures are designed to scale with the party's progression from levels 1-10.
