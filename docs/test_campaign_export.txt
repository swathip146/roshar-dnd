=== CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW ===
CHUNK_TYPE: Overview
CAMPAIGN: Secrets Beneath the Gilded Griffin
When patrons of the Gilded Griffin tavern begin disappearing, the party must uncover a conspiracy involving smugglers, ancient crypts, and a network of tunnels beneath the town. What starts as missing persons quickly escalates into a web of corruption reaching the highest levels of local government.

=== CAMPAIGN BACKGROUND ===
CHUNK_TYPE: Background
CAMPAIGN: Secrets Beneath the Gilded Griffin
Millhaven sits at the crossroads of three kingdoms, making it a hub for legitimate trade and illicit smuggling. Beneath the town lies an ancient network of crypts dedicated to Kelemvor, long forgotten by most residents. The Gilded Griffin tavern, built over one of the main entrances, has unknowingly become the center of a smuggling operation run by corrupt town officials who discovered the tunnels' existence. Recent expansion of their operations has led to the kidnapping of witnesses and the awakening of undead guardians in the deeper crypts.

=== MAIN PLOT ===
CHUNK_TYPE: Plot
CAMPAIGN: Secrets Beneath the Gilded Griffin
The campaign begins when Escobert, the tavern keeper of the Gilded Griffin, approaches the party about mysterious disappearances of his patrons. Investigation reveals that certain guests who asked too many questions or stayed too late have vanished without a trace. The party discovers a hidden sally port behind barrels in the tavern's cellar, secured with locks whose keys Escobert carries unknowingly - given to him by the previous owner as 'storage room keys.' The tunnels beyond lead to a network of natural caves and ancient crypts, now serving as a smuggling route for weapons and stolen goods. The party must navigate trapped passages, confront kobold sentries working for the smugglers, and ultimately face both the corrupt Captain Thorne who leads the operation and the awakened undead guardians of Kelemvor's crypts. The climax occurs when the party must choose between exposing the corruption publicly or working with reformed smugglers to seal the crypts and protect the town from a growing undead threat.

=== DM NOTES ===
CHUNK_TYPE: DM_Notes
CAMPAIGN: Secrets Beneath the Gilded Griffin
This campaign balances investigation, dungeon exploration, and moral complexity. Use the Fighter's Dueling fighting style for Captain Thorne to create a memorable boss fight. The kobolds should feel like hired muscle rather than evil monsters - they're working for payment, not malice. Allow multiple solutions to encounters, especially the final confrontation with Brother Matthias. Track the party's reputation in town as their investigation progresses, as this affects NPC reactions and potential endings. The secret passages can be expanded with additional chambers if you need more content, and consider having some passages connect to other buildings in town for extended investigation opportunities.
