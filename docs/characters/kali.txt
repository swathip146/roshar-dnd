FEATURES AND TRAITS:
- However, based on the fragments I can see, here are what appear to be the core features for a level 1 character of this class:
- **Spellcasting: The Radiant gains the ability to cast Invested Arts (this class's version of spells) using Charisma as their spellcasting ability. They know cantrips and have spell slots for casting higher-level Invested Arts.**
- **Investiture Points: The Radiant gains a pool of Investiture points that can be spent to enhance their Invested Arts through various Surgebinding Techniques.**
- **Spren Bond: The Radiant forms a bond with a Cryptic spren, which functions as a familiar and grants additional abilities. The Cryptic has specific stats and abilities as shown in the stat block.**
- **Surgebinding Study: The Radiant learns techniques to modify their Invested Arts, though specific level 1 techniques aren't clearly defined in the provided text.**
- **Note:** This appears to be homebrew content rather than official D&D 5e material. The complete level 1 features would need the full, unfragmented class description to provide accurate details about starting proficiencies, hit points, equipment, and the complete list of initial abilities.

- **Age:** Reach adulthood in their mid-teens and live to about 70 years old
- **Creature Type:** Humans (humanoid)
- **Size:** Medium (about 6 to 6Â½ feet tall on average)
