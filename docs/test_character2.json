    "**Martial Arts:** Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles using Unarmed Strikes and Monk weapons (Simple Melee weapons and Martial Melee weapons with the Light property). While unarmored and wielding only Monk weapons, you gain three benefits: you can make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action, you can roll 1d6 in place of normal damage for Unarmed Strikes or Monk weapons, and you can use Dexterity instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls with these weapons (including for Grapple/Shove save DCs).",
    "**Unarmored Defense:** While not wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier, allowing you to rely on your martial training and awareness rather than heavy protection.",
