  "last_scenario_text": "**Turn 25 - The Battle Intensifies**\n\nYour coordinated assault proves devastatingly effective as magical energies and steel pierce through the Corrupted Greatshells' thick carapaces, dropping both massive creatures in a thunderous crash that shakes the plateau. However, your focused fire has allowed the four Voidspren-touched Chasmfiends to close the distance, their violet-crackling claws now scrabbling up the rocky slopes toward your position. The largest Chasmfiend lets out an otherworldly shriek that seems to tear at your very soul, while dark energy pulses from the Voidspren embedded in their shells.\n\n**Choose your action:**\n\n1. **Athletics Check (DC 15)** - Leap onto the back of the nearest climbing Chasmfiend to attack its vulnerable neck joints before it can reach the top of your defensive position\n\n2. **Intimidation Check (DC 16)** - Channel your recent victory over the Greatshells into a terrifying war cry, attempting to break the Chasmfiends' coordinated assault through sheer force of presence\n\n3. **Combat** - Stand your ground and engage all four Chasmfiends in melee combat as they crest the ridge (4 Voidspren-touched Chasmfiends at close range)\n\n4. Use the momentum from your ranged success to execute a fighting retreat toward the depot's ballista emplacements, forcing the Chasmfiends to follow you into a more defensible chokepoint",
