Below, you spot something concerning: a Veden supply caravan has ground to a halt near one of the permanent bridges spanning a particularly wide chasm. Through your spyglass, you can see figures moving erratically around the wagons - but these aren't the ordered movements of guards or merchants.\n\nSuddenly, a bone-chilling screech echoes across the plateau as a pack of **chasmfiends** - smaller cousins of the legendary greatshells - have emerged from the depths and are attacking the caravan! The creatures, each the size of a large horse with chitinous armor gleaming purple-black in the sunlight, have already overturned two wagons. You can see survivors desperately trying to fend them off with spears and crossbows, but they're clearly outmatched.\n\n**What do you do?**\n\n1. **Charge in immediately** to help the caravan, rushing down the slope with weapons drawn to engage the chasmfiends in direct combat.\n\n2. **Approach stealthily** along the chasm's edge to get a better assessment of the situation and potentially flank the creatures from an unexpected angle.\n\n3. **Use ranged attacks** from your elevated position on the ridge to thin out the chasmfiend pack before moving closer.\n\n4. **Signal the caravan** and try to coordinate a strategy with the survivors while looking for environmental advantages you could exploit in the fight.",
