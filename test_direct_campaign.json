  "title": "The Whispered Pages",
  "theme": "Mystery",
  "setting": "The ancient Thornwick Library in the cemetery district of Waterdeep",
  "level_range": "3-5",
  "duration": "6-8 sessions",
  "overview": "Scholars are disappearing from Waterdeep's most prestigious library, leaving behind only cryptic messages written in blood. The party must uncover the dark secret binding the library's ghostly inhabitants to prevent a necromantic ritual from consuming the city's knowledge and souls.",
  "background": "The Thornwick Library was built atop an ancient burial ground dedicated to Kelemvor, god of the dead. For centuries, it served as Waterdeep's premier repository of knowledge until a catastrophic fire 50 years ago killed the head librarian, Erasmus Thornwick, and several scholars. The library was rebuilt, but strange occurrences began plaguing visitors. Recently, the disappearances have escalated as someone seeks to complete Thornwick's final, forbidden research into binding souls to written words, creating an army of spectral knowledge-seekers.",
  "main_plot": "The campaign begins when the party is hired to investigate missing scholars. Initial exploration reveals the library is haunted by restless spirits who communicate through cryptic riddles and shifting text on pages. The party discovers that Erasmus Thornwick's spirit, driven mad by his incomplete research, is compelling living scholars to finish his work by possessing them during their studies. The climax occurs in the library's hidden basement sanctum where Thornwick attempts to complete a massive ritual circle using the blood and souls of the missing scholars. The party must solve ancient puzzles, face spectral guardians, and confront Thornwick's corrupted spirit before he can transform all of Waterdeep's knowledge into a necromantic weapon that would bind every literate soul in the city to his will.",
