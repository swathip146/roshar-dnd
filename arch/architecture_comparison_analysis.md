**Example Comparison:**

**My Plan:**
```python
@dataclass
class Scenario:
    description: str
    choices: List[Choice]
    triggers_combat: bool = False
    difficulty_modifier: int = 0
```

**Original Plan:**
```json
{
  "scene": "Narrative description",
  "choices": [
    {
      "id": "c1", 
      "title": "Sneak across the ledge",
      "skill_hints": ["Stealth"],
      "suggested_dc": {"easy": 10, "medium": 15, "hard": 20},
      "combat_trigger": false
    }
  ],
  "effects": [{"type": "flag", "name": "alert_guard", "value": true}],

3. Policy Engine â†’ compute advantage/disadvantage, house rules
4. Dice Roller â†’ execute rolls with full logging
5. Rules Enforcer â†’ compare vs DC, determine success/failure
6. Game Engine â†’ apply state changes, log outcome
7. Decision Log â†’ record complete provenance chain

**Pros of My Approach:**
- âœ… Simpler implementation
- âœ… Faster execution
- âœ… Standard D&D feel

## Conclusion

Both plans are excellent, but serve different goals:

- **My Plan**: Fast, simple, focused on getting a playable D&D game quickly
- **Original Plan**: Sophisticated, robust, focused on long-term scalability

The **hybrid approach** gives you the best of both worlds - fast initial development with a clear path to production-ready architecture.
