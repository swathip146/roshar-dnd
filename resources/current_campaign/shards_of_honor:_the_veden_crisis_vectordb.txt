CAMPAIGN: Shards of Honor: The Veden Crisis
The Everstorm has awakened ancient Voidbringers who now march on Vedens with their corrupted singer allies. Two of the surviving Heralds have emerged from hiding to guide new Knights Radiant, as the spren have begun bonding with humans once again in desperate response to the growing threat.

Sessions 2-4 involve traveling to three key locations to retrieve these treasures while speaking higher oaths and growing in power. Session 5 culminates in a massive battlefield where allied forces of humans, honorspren, and reformed singers fight alongside the players against Voidbringers, corrupted singers, and Odium's forces to prevent the completion of a ritual that would shatter the barrier between Roshar and the realm of Odium.

=== DM NOTES ===
CHUNK_TYPE: DM_Notes
CAMPAIGN: Shards of Honor: The Veden Crisis
This compressed 5-session campaign focuses on rapid character growth through oath progression. Each location provides a treasure that directly enables the next phase of advancement - the Oathstone enables Second Oaths, the Codex enables Third Oaths, and the Perpendicularity Key provides the power needed for the final battle. Work with players to select their Radiant Orders early and prepare their oath progressions. The spren should be active NPCs with distinct personalities. Use the Dueling fighting style for Shardblade combat. The final battle should feel epic with multiple waves of enemies and allied NPCs fighting alongside the players. Consider using mass combat rules to handle the large-scale nature of the final encounter while keeping player agency central.
