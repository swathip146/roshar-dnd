## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Agent-Based Multi-Agent Framework

The system is built around a sophisticated **agent framework** (`agent_framework.py` - 715 lines) that provides:

```python
# Core Architecture Components
BaseAgent          # Abstract base class for all agents
AgentOrchestrator   # Central coordination and lifecycle management
MessageBus          # Thread-safe inter-agent communication
AgentMessage        # Structured message dataclass
```

**Key Features:**
- **Thread-Safe Communication**: Concurrent message processing with queue-based routing
- **Lifecycle Management**: Start/stop agents, health monitoring, graceful shutdown
- **Extensible Design**: Plugin architecture for adding new agents
- **Error Resilience**: Circuit breakers, timeout handling, error recovery

### 1.2 Main Orchestrator

The **ModularDMAssistant** (`modular_dm_assistant_refactored.py`) serves as the system orchestrator:

```python
class ModularDMAssistant:
    def __init__(self):
        self.orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator()
        self._initialize_agents()  # 13+ specialized agents
        self.command_handler = ManualCommandHandler()  # 126+ commands
        self.active_session = None
```

**Initialization Sequence:**
1. **Agent Registration**: 13+ specialized agents registered with orchestrator

    "location": "Feywild",
    "previous_encounters": ["goblin_ambush", "fairy_court"]
}
response = scenario_generator.generate_scenario(query, context)
```

#### 5.2.3 NPC Background Integration
```python
# Example: NPC dialogue with campaign history
npc_query = "What does the tavern keeper know about the missing merchant?"
context = campaign_manager.get_relevant_events("merchant_disappearance")
response = npc_controller.generate_dialogue(npc_query, context)
```

### 5.3 RAG Performance Optimization

chat_generator = ChatGenerator(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0"
)
```

**Vector Database (Qdrant):**
```python
# Haystack integration with Qdrant
from haystack_integrations.document_stores.qdrant import QdrantDocumentStore

document_store = QdrantDocumentStore(
    host="localhost",
    port=6333,
    index="dnd_knowledge",
    embedding_dim=384
)
```

### 8.2 Plugin Architecture

**Agent Registration System:**
```python
# Dynamic agent loading
class AgentOrchestrator:
    def register_agent(self, agent: BaseAgent):
        self.agents[agent.agent_id] = agent
        self.message_bus.add_route(agent.agent_id, agent.handle_message)
        agent.set_message_sender(self.send_message)
```

**Extension Points:**
- **Custom Agents**: New agent types for specialized functionality
- **Command Extensions**: Additional command patterns and handlers
- **Content Generators**: Custom content generation pipelines
- **Rule Systems**: Alternative or house rule implementations

### 8.3 API and Interface Design

**Message Interface:**
```python
@dataclass
class AgentMessage:
    message_id: str
    source_agent: str
    target_agent: str
    message_type: MessageType
    data: Dict[str, Any]
    timestamp: float
    correlation_id: Optional[str] = None
```

**Command Interface:**
```python
class BaseCommandHandler:
    def handle_command(self, command: str, game_state: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Standardized command processing interface
        pass
```
