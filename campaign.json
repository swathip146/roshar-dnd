  "background": "The Everstorm has awakened ancient Voidbringers who now march on Vedens with their corrupted singer allies. Two of the surviving Heralds have emerged from hiding to guide new Knights Radiant, as the spren have begun bonding with humans once again in desperate response to the growing threat. The players must quickly master their oaths and abilities to prevent Vedens from falling and triggering a new Desolation that could consume all of Roshar.",
  "main_plot": "Session 1 begins with the characters experiencing their first spren bond during a Voidbringer attack on a border town, speaking their First Oath to gain Radiant powers. Guided by the Herald Kalak, they learn of the threat and must gather three ancient artifacts to stop the enemy's ritual. Sessions 2-4 involve traveling to three key locations to retrieve these treasures while speaking higher oaths and growing in power. Session 5 culminates in a massive battlefield where allied forces of humans, honorspren, and reformed singers fight alongside the players against Voidbringers, corrupted singers, and Odium's forces to prevent the completion of a ritual that would shatter the barrier between Roshar and the realm of Odium.",

Work with players to select their Radiant Orders early and prepare their oath progressions. The spren should be active NPCs with distinct personalities. Use the Dueling fighting style for Shardblade combat. The final battle should feel epic with multiple waves of enemies and allied NPCs fighting alongside the players. Consider using mass combat rules to handle the large-scale nature of the final encounter while keeping player agency central.",
