  "level_range": "1-15",
  "duration": "25-30 sessions",
  "overview": "An ambitious sorcerer named Malachar the Crimson seeks to merge the Material Plane with the Shadowfell to become a god-emperor. The heroes must gather ancient artifacts, forge alliances, and master their abilities to prevent the world's transformation into a realm of eternal darkness.",
  "background": "For centuries, the Veil of Worlds has kept the planes separate, maintained by five Keystones of Balance hidden across the realm. Malachar the Crimson, once a court wizard who was exiled for forbidden research, has spent decades in the Shadowfell learning to manipulate planar boundaries. He has returned with an army of shadow creatures and cultists, systematically destroying the Keystones to weaken the barriers between worlds. As reality begins to fracture, undead rise spontaneously, shadows gain malevolent life, and the sun dims with each passing day.",
  "main_plot": "The campaign begins with strange occurrences in the border town of Millhaven - shadows moving independently, livestock dying mysteriously, and reports of hooded figures in the nearby woods. Investigation reveals cultists of the Crimson Order working to destroy the first Keystone. After preventing this initial catastrophe, the heroes learn of Malachar's grand design from a dying cultist. They must race across the kingdom to protect the remaining four Keystones: one hidden in the dwarven citadel of Ironhold, another in the elven sanctuary of Silverleaf Grove, the third beneath the capital city of Goldspire, and the final one in the mysterious Floating Towers of the ancient mages. Each location presents unique challenges as Malachar's influence grows stronger. The final confrontation takes place in Malachar's Shadowfell fortress, where reality itself becomes a battlefield and the heroes must not only defeat the sorcerer but repair the damage to the planar barriers before both worlds are consumed by chaos.",

  "dm_notes": "This campaign focuses on escalating stakes and growing character investment in the world's fate. Use environmental storytelling to show the increasing planar corruption - shadows behaving strangely, temperature fluctuations, and reality 'hiccups.' Allow players to feel the weight of each failed Keystone protection as the world becomes more dangerous. The dueling fighting style from the retrieved knowledge works well for NPCs like Sir Gareth. Consider introducing moral complexity by showing that some cultists joined Malachar out of desperation rather than evil. Plan for multiple possible endings based on how many Keystones the heroes successfully protect.",
